UPenn,GMAT Club,"The Wharton MBA program has the deepest curriculum I could think off in finance. Moreover, the school provides training and access to all the top wall street courses to help folks from non-finance transition to finance.

In terms of visibility from employers, banking, consulting and investing are all hot on recruiting. If you network well with the employer, put in the right effort, and do all your prep thoroughly - I don’t think there's much stopping you from getting your dream job. Obviously, things have been a bit harder this year, but even then, relatively its much stronger than other schools.

Overall, I’d say if you want to pivot to banking or investing (PE/HF/Long Only Investing), you have the best resources in terms of clubs and classes to make this happen for you, and have all the top employers you would imagine coming on campus to hire you.

For me, the school helped me meet the needs to transition to an investing role (at least for summer) in the US.

As a future applicant, I’d say focus on displaying your quantitative aptitude. For what its worth people are very sharp, and you want to showcase yourself to be up there and do enough research to get to know the school and resources. I am six months in and still learning more about Penn and the offerings of the MBA program. Speak to enough people and get a good sense of how you want to spend your time here.",,,
UPenn,GMAT Club,"Wharton is excellent when it comes to the brand, alumni network, and faculty. I am part of the HCM program and I was pleasantly surprised by the opportunities and connections that the program provides. I knew going in that the network is solid but never could I have ever imagined the true power of the alumni network. You really have to experience it to know the full extent to which it helps.
The classes so far have been really great even in COVID times. The school is trying really hard to make the classes engaging given the situation. Definitely very rigorous and quant heavy. Everything is solved analytically in classes.
Classmates and the community is real. Even during COVID most of the class is in Philly that helped us bond in a socially distanced manner. I would highly encourage anyone looking at an MBA to apply to Wharton for any career choice.",,,
UPenn,GMAT Club,"My time so far at Wharton has been enriching from an academic standpoint as I have found the profs very impressive, and most of the course work relevant to my future goals. Additionally, I feel that Wharton has put me in a strong position for recruiting into IB as the structured recruiting process has made connecting with banks and bankers easier than expected.

Unfortunately, COVID-19 has made networking with my peers and making friends more challenging than it should be, and the lack of club activity definitely hurts. Hopefully these issues will be cleared up before the start of year 2.",,,
UPenn,GMAT Club,"I have been admitted to Wharton's Class of 2020. I have been very satisfied with my experience and exposure in the school so far. Wharton has a very dedicated staff working constantly to provide the best student experience. They have a huge focus on 'maximizing Wharton experience' and are committed to achieving this target. I was amazed by the way they have effectively and efficiently managed a class size of 800, ensuring sufficient networking opportunities in both small and large group settings. The school is committed to help you not only get the best professional career path, but grow as an individual. Wharton has an approx. 3 weeks of pre-class program, where the intent is to familiarize the student with the different school resources and work on one's teamwork & leadership skills. This ensured that I had sufficient time to settle down in school, and not feel overwhelmed with the various resources/ opportunities available. Wharton also has its flagship course on 'Teamwork and Leadership' which is specifically focused on teaching managers to build effective teams via a patented simulation analysis. For career services, the school does not allow employeer chats/ session in the first quarter, so that students get sufficient time to prepare. The school has a dedicated career services team which is divided basis the various industries. We can book regular advising sessions with them, and clarify all our doubts over mail as well. They are very responsive. For student life, the school has a club for everything you can possibly imagine. So it's important to be clear with the intent of pursuing a certain activity. In short, I am pleasantly very pleased with Wharton's overall culture. Everyone is very nice, and tries to help each other. The school has a huge focus on teamwork which gets reflected in all the course assignments that we get. One opportunity area could be in terms of student diversity. The school is filled with consultants and bankers.",,,
UPenn,GMAT Club,"I started my own company during Wharton and have been working on it full-time since. Wharton prepared me well for all aspects of startup life. I have relied a ton on the Wharton network and have always been amazed by how helpful classmates are. The Philly Entrepreneurship system continues to grow rapidly. Definitely make sure you join both Founder's Club and the Entrepreneurship Club!
Courses are also a great way to get free help from brilliant classmates on your startup. In particular, I highly recommend the soft skill courses, such as Influence and Negotiations, which are invaluable. The hard skill courses that stood out include Legal Aspects of Entrepreneurship and Entrepreneurship through Acquisition. Finally, the brand has helped significantly in opening doors for my company.",,,
UPenn,GMAT Club,"I am extremely happy at Wharton. Philadelphia is a great place to go to school. You get the resources of a city, but on top of that, everyone lives within a mile radius, creating a tight new community. Everyone embraces the “My Wharton” mentality, making the most of what they want of the experience. Whether you want to focus on classes, clubs, social life or family, there is a place and plentiful opportunity for you. The classes, especially the electives, have great content and professors. All of the top consulting firms and investment banks come to Wharton, and the clubs/career services do a great job preparing you for those interviews. I would suggest that anyone serious about a great network and education to consider this school.",,,
UPenn,GMAT Club,"Prior to business school I worked at a hedge fund but knew I wanted to get into management and operations. High priority for me was getting into the best school I could and Wharton was my #1 choice. Why over H/S and others? It came down to people; of all the alumni from the schools I knew, I got along best with Wharton people and my 3 years did not disappoint.

I'm getting in, best advice is to find someone with 3 characteristics who can help you: they've been through the MBA process successfully, they know you well, and they are candid. If you don't have someone like that in your life then hit on as many as possible. Do your best and forget the rest!

I got an internship and accepted full time with an MBB but had a lot of other unique opportunities in management, startups, and finance. Wharton will be great for 99% of people. The only place it came up a bit short on career oops was in PE and HF, but I believe it would have been the same for all programs given the ad IOC nature of hiring. For anything blue chip, Wharton is great, plus the San Francisco center is an amazing opportunity for those interested in the bay.

Biggest complaint is that the classes are run by academics as opposed to practitioners and the classes feel to academic. I wish the curriculum were more practical.

Socially, the school does a TON to facilitate friendships and invests a lot in the class.

Overall a great program a very happy with my investment and the prospects it is providing me.",,,
UPenn,GMAT Club,"After the first year of bschool, I will say that it has been a fun experience. I've met some great people and have been able to travel to some fantastic places, however, career wise, I can't say at this point that it's been worth the tuition. Unless you want to go into finance or consulting, the career options post business school may be a bit disappointing and limited. Industries are not as open to career switchers as bschools make them out to be. If you know exactly what you want to do in two years, then you'll hopefully be able to make the most out of your bschool experience. However, if you're looking to ""find yourself"" or ""explore"", I'm not sure you'll be able to do so in the limited amount of time/worth the amount you're paying.",,,
UPenn,GMAT Club,"Without the Lauder program, I wouldn't have gone to Wharton. With its small group size (~70 students) and amazing international programming, it was an incredible academic, social, and personal experience. As a somewhat introverted person, the huge class size of Wharton was intimidating. Having a solid base of friends and contacts through Lauder made navigating Wharton much easier.

One thing that pleasantly surprised me about Wharton was the lack of competition among students in classes. Thanks to the grade non-disclosure policy, I found my classmates very willing to help one another.

Another huge selling point on Wharton for me is the breadth of the alumni network. While many schools have huge regional concentrations of alumni, Wharton has pretty even global coverage, with obvious hubs in NYC and SF.
If I could change anything about Wharton, it would be the classroom technology policy. I wish Wharton would adopt a full-blown, accross-the-board technology ban in class as is done at HBS. The quality of class participation suffered significantly due to students working on laptops, phones, and tablets during class. It was very distracting. and a shame given the investment we all made to be there.",,,
UPenn,GMAT Club,"I applied with a consulting background and a liberal arts undergrad degree. While living in Philly after growing up in California wasnt the best (hello snow!), it was a great college town and the MBA program is really a little bubble within the city, both on campus and where students typically live. The school has an amazing alumni and career management support system, and their healthcare program is top notch. And dont discount brand - everywhere in the world, people know what Wharton is.

Through the program, I was able to land a job at a bulge bracket investment bank fairly easily, so I would say this school is a safe bet if that is the field you are interested in. Finally, the people you will meet are the most smart, well-grounded people EVER. If you go, get ready for 2 years of fun and hard work, both in class and outside of class!",,,
UPenn,GMAT Club,"There are many things that can be said about Wharton, but the full time MBA program has far exceeded my expectations. My classmates are collegial and supportive, the professors are world class and leaders in their industry, and the amount of career opportunities I've been exposed to is staggering. I was really on the fence between Wharton and another program and would go back and make the same decision again in a heartbeat if I could. Could not be happier with my decision.

The two biggest perks of the program, in my experience, are the student body and the alumni. My classmates have worked in nearly every country on Earth, at nearly every company you could think of, and in an incredibly wide range of roles. If I want to learn more about the McKinsey office in Moscow, I can grab lunch with someone who spent 2 years there tomorrow. If I'm curious about working in a fintech startup in San Francisco, I can grab coffee with someone that was employee #3 at one later today. If I want to know the gritty details about working at Goldman TMT in NYC, I can bump into a person that did that between classes. I didn't fully understand how valuable that level of connection would be until I got here and was able to take advantage of it before the waves of recruiting hit during my first year.

The alumni support has been very impressive. Coming into school, I knew I wanted to work in a certain industry in a certain geographic area, so I started reaching out to alumni from both schools I was considering to get a feel of the strength of each network. The Wharton alumni far and away were the most responsive and receptive to me and several of them went beyond the extra mile to meet or chat with me during my decision process. Since I've been a student, that aspect has only improved. I may be an anomaly, but I've had a hit rate of 100% when it comes to returned emails, phone calls, or coffee / lunch invitations from alumni. I know the burden will be on me someday to repay the favor to the next set of students, but I cannot overstate how strong and open the Wharton network has been for me thus far.

I thought the competition between students would be extremely cutthroat based on what I heard from some of the older alumni at my pre-MBA firm, but that hasn't been true at all. All of my classmates are extremely helpful and there isn't this ""I win if I can make you lose"" mentality like I was expecting. I think the TBD interview style really works to wash out the gunners before they get to campus.

The amount of electives and flexibility you have within the degree programs thanks to the short fixed core classes program is really fantastic. You can get as deep or as broad as you want in any subject and I've really taken advantage of it by using the course catalogue as a shopping menu for classes that I think sound interesting outside my chosen field of study.

WAY more tech firms and start ups recruit at Wharton than I thought would when I was applying. I come from a finance background and plan to continue in the investment field after school, but I've been pleasantly surprised at the amount of opportunity that exists beyond the typical financial roles. The school has a finance reputation for a reason, but there is a big push from the leadership to expand entrepreneurship and tech stuff and it's really starting to show when you look at the post-MBA jobs a lot of people are taking.",,,
UPenn,GMAT Club,"Wharton has been a great experience, but it has been more difficult than I had expected. There is definite truth when they say that you will have no free time, since classes, clubs, social activities and recruiting take up so much take.

The people are honestly some of the best people I have met - everyone is approachable and willing to help you out, no one sabotages anyone, etc.

Wharton also has a lot more to offer than finance - in fact, I think that more students go into consulting and tech than into finance.

The only complaint I have is that it is too far from where all the students live (or maybe that was our own fault).

To future applicants I would suggest visiting the school and talking to students to really learn what they think, the students are honest and won't sugar coat anything . Really learn what differentiates Wharton.",,,
UPenn,GMAT Club,"To be honest, most of MBA curriculum can be learned almost anywhere. What's made the difference to me at Wharton is the community. Wharton has an amazing cluster and cohort system that encourages students to get to know each other. It's Philadelphia location and the fact that most students live in Rittenhouse helps foster a sense of community. I can't walk down the street without running into someone I know, which builds the strong relationships I wanted in my MBA experience. I think that's why the alumni network is also so strong. The network is really bi-coastal and international and I've had a lot of help/networking success with alums.

Other highlights at Wharton include the amazing speakers that come to the school, the opportunitues to build up strategy/innovation experience through the field application project program and the collaborative innovation project program, and the Semester in SF program. I've loved my classes with Profs. Adam Grant, David Bell, Luke Taylor, and Bari Harlam.

The professors in general can be a hit or miss. They're generally okay and some of the long term ones seem like they couldn't give a care about teaching. We do have some superstars (see above) and they're very much worth taking a class with.

Also, I'm convinced Philadelphia is one of the most underrated cities in the US. I loved in SF and DC before school (and spent a lot of time in NYC) and absolutely love Philly. It's inexpensive to live in, the food scene is amazing, and it's architecturally beautiful. The weather is typical East Coast weather so winter isn't the best, but can't complain about much else. It's gotten a lot safer in the last few years and I feel safer here than SF.
",,,
UPenn,GMAT Club,"Pros:
-Access to huge alumni network that so far has been very willing to help
-Network of extremely smart and talented classmates (with some exceptions)
-Campus and presence in SF helps with tech/VC recruiting

Cons:
-Facilities provided don't stack up to other top programs (we can't even use the campus gym without paying $300+ per year)
-Location is not as exciting as other top programs
-Lack of experiential based learning opportunities
-Wharton needs to work on and invest more into its branding - its reputation has slipped a bit over the last decade to where it is no longer considered on the same tier as HBS and Stanford",,,
UPenn,Niche,"Intensive but interesting. Great people, but professor quality varied. Lectures tend to be very interesting, but are high level in some cases. Coming from an engineering background, this felt ""easy"", but it is a different type of learning- more focused on the concepts than proving theories and underlying complexities. TAs are great and there is a lot of effort put towards making students understand the material. Since there isn't a sink or swim culture, I think it incentivizes learning for the sake of learning rather than curving to a ""B"".
Professors are very friendly and actually enjoy getting to know their students.",,,
UPenn,Niche,"Getting through Penn is a huge accomplishment. It is highly competitive and stressful, mostly because of the Wharton School mindset seems to permeate to the other colleges as well. Mental health is a huge issue for many students and it seems like many students are not getting adequately treated. The school does have a lot of resources for students compared to other schools. There are support systems and great professors if you know where to look.",,,
UPenn,Niche,"There are plenty of majors and courses to choose from. Course Match, which is the system we use to select classes allows students to create their schedule based on their preferences and class seats without the rush of first come first serve. Academic advisors, TAs, and professors are available virtually and in-person to guide students from course selection to course completion.

Though academic advisors are available, they are typically not that helpful. It's best to chat with former students about how they handled Course Match and which classes / professors to take.",,,
UPenn,Niche,"My experience so far has been a blend of two worlds, least developed and developed economy. very enriching and mind blowing, refreshing, challenging and inspiring.
administrators are easy to talk to and are so resourceful with a quick response to problems and always willing to help. very understanding, simple and relatable.
teachers are knowledgeable, accessible and emphatic. they are always willing too share knowledge, explain and even meet u out of class hours for continuous explanations and interactions.

Classes are so fun and interactive, a mixture of seminars, lectures, bootcamps, clinics, debates, presentations and interactive sessions. Class sessions were all in person acreating stronger bond between students, teachers, administration..

With a diverse class of individuals, with students from different countries tires and nationalities, add to the rich cultural exchange, language and diverse atmosphere. it feels like I made a trip to 36 countries while in the same place.",,,
UPenn,Niche,"The best part of doing an MBA at Wharton is the quality of education and the vast opportunities it provides. The program challenges students to think critically, develop leadership skills, and gain practical experience through hands-on projects and internships. The school also has a vast alumni and corporate partners network, providing students with great internship and career opportunities. Finally, the social aspect is unlike any other.

On the other hand, the curse of all these opportunities is balancing everything. The program offers interesting classes, clubs, travel experiences, and networking events, which can overwhelm some students. Additionally, the tuition and living expenses in Philadelphia can be quite steep.",,,
UPenn,Niche,"Penn is so diverse I have been here one term so far and have met at least 4/5 people from each continent. Also, they are so friendly. The staff is diverse too and there are open groups discussing LGBT, religion and race. I have met people from diverse economic background so I would really rate Penn highly on such integration.

Acceptance is very high. Am actually a member of a christian prayer group but most people are from different religions and they go to different churches on Sunday - and that's acceptable.

There is open talk about current political situations... and people are very honest about their opinions (It's not ''weird'' talking about politics - Even though I haven't seen die-hard political groups promoting their agendas",,,
Northwestern,GMAT Club,"Collaborative atmosphere: Many students appreciate the collaborative and supportive environment at Kellogg, where they are able to work with classmates from diverse backgrounds and industries.

Strong academic programs: The curriculum is challenging but also very engaging, and students say they feel well-prepared for their careers after graduation.

Real-world experience: Kellogg is known for its hands-on approach to business education, and students appreciate the opportunity to work on real-world projects and case studies.

Networking opportunities: The Kellogg network is one of the strongest in the world, and students say they appreciate the connections they make while at the school and after they graduate.

Supportive community: Students also appreciate the strong sense of community at Kellogg, where they are able to receive support from faculty, staff, and alumni throughout their time at the school and beyond.",,,
Northwestern,GMAT Club,"An MBA program that provides a broad based general management education and at the same time enables to focus on niche areas such as Data Analytics for decision making and Public-Private initiatives. There are plenty of student-led activities that can be classified into Professional, Cultural, and Interest clubs. The student body is surely very vibrant. The new building is state of the art and has a new level of energy all together.

Applicants should conduct deep research about the program and clearly illustrate ways they can contribute to the Kellogg community. Also, examples of teamwork and collaboration in the essays and interview should go a long way as the school prides itself on these attributes.

Recruiting is a mostly self-driven process. School brand might not make as much difference as one may think.",,,
Northwestern,GMAT Club,"Very strong collaborative culture and student body. You can always learn from peers, and they are happy to share. Career-wise, regardless of the industry that you are interested in or passionate for, you can always get supports from the career management center, student clubs, alumni network, and curriculum. In addition to technical skills, such as data analytics and finance, thoughtful leadership and effective communication are also the highlights of my learnings at Kellogg. Moreover, current students and faculty just moved to the new building, which has improved facilities and much more open spaces and flexibilities for student to work ttogether. I would suggest applicants to explore Kellogg's culture and think about how to contribute to this community.",,,
Northwestern,GMAT Club,"The school is famous for its collaborative culture. As an international student, I was still able to make many good friends at Kellogg. It really helped a lot on my career advancement, I got the job I wanted and received lots of helps from Kellogg alumni network along the way. The two years at Kellogg, I had some really great memories during my two years at Kellogg. There were many fun student-initiated activities, such as international travels, formals, weekly parties and gatherings. Highly recommend the school, especially if you are looking for consulting or tech career, Kellogg will be the right place for you.",,,
Northwestern,GMAT Club,"Coming from a non traditional background, before Kellogg I could barely use Excel. My previous leadership experiences were very real world and high pressure. The one thing I knew I had to focus on during my MBA was my quantitative skills.

At Kellogg, I took several classes on statistics, analytical decision making, and even coding. For someone who couldn't do a vlookup, I left Kellogg knowing how to code in Stata and R. The best classes for that were Marketing Research, Customer Analytics, and Analytical decision modeling.

Professors were great and extremely helpful in helping me figure out what languages to study and what I could do with the newly-acquired skills.

I work today at a large techfin company doing product management with a focus on data science in the Bay Area. If you think Kellogg is a ""soft"" school, think again. You can earn all the hard skills needed to succeed in the age of big data.

Recruiting is the hardest part. It's really stressful. But everyone makes it, and I can say that almost everyone I know got the jobs they wanted and are doing really well in the their careers. Be laser-focused on the industry and companies you're interested in, but allow about 20% of your time to search for other options always. Recruiting might not turn out the way you expected and having a plan B really pays.",,,
Northwestern,GMAT Club,"When I applied to business schools, I knew I was looking for a few key things (not necessarily in order):

-- Success with placing students into good consulting careers
-- Supportive/friendly environment
-- Strong brand recognition
-- International opportunities

Kellogg has met my expectations on these criteria and exceeded it in others. Several of the above are things that you can pick up from reading the internet, but to experience it is an entirely different thing.

Sure, Kellogg has great stats when it comes to placing folks into good consulting jobs. However, I didn't realize HOW this happened before coming. The school does a great job of offering equal opportunities for success (particularly through the ""bid"" system, whereby you can bid ""points"" to get an interview with a company even if they didn't choose you). Further, the student body is incredibly supportive -- numerous people have gone out of their way to help me prepare for my interviews. Thanks to this system and environment, I was able to get a job with one of my most desired consulting firms!

The international opportunities have been numerous and incredible. At a certain point there happens to be TOO MANY (if you can believe it) opportunities to travel -- you have to be selective about how you spend your time/money!

But beyond these things, its simply a wonderful community. I've learned a ton from my classes and peers. I've met an incredible number of friendly people who are extraordinarily accomplished already. We had a terrible building (the Jake), but now we're in a wonderful new building (the Global Hub) which is a great environment for working and collaborating.",,,
Northwestern,GMAT Club,"The most unique aspect of Kellogg School of Management (Northwestern University) is it's social and collaborative spirit. Most classwork is done in groups - including Finance and Accounting assignments - that teaches you to not only work in a group setting but to pull your own weight. This is an essential trait for corporate success, and IMHO all business schools should focus more on this. The collaborative spirit also shines during the placement season, when students are more than willing to help each other out with mock interviews and study sessions - surprisingly even when competing for the same job. Furthermore, the social aspect is also evident in the in numerous party events that keep happening throughout the school tenure. Kellogg will teach you to be a good team-player.",,,
Northwestern,GMAT Club,"Kellogg was definitely a great experience. The school offered a huge variety of opportunities and everyone I met was able to find a job in the field they were looking for.

It did not disappoint on the social component either. I made great friends from a variety of nationalities and backgrounds that have also helped me in my professional life. Additionally, Kellogg's location is both great to creating this small college-town tight atmosphere and provide the benefits of a big city.",,,
Northwestern,GMAT Club,"Kellogg exceeded my expectations. From the very beginning, the program provided a lot of support and networking opportunities. They did a good job with ensuring that students felt prepared upon started. Even though most incoming students claim to know what exactly they want to do post MBA, Kellogg encourages students to do self discovery and really think about lots of possibilities. I loved getting involved with many organizations and programs while in school. There really was an option for everything. I ended up going with a non traditional career path for recruiting, so the hardest part about my experience was having fewer resources and networking contacts immediately available to me. Instead, I had to do more off-campus networking and searching, which can become frustrating when you see lots of classmates going through a completely on-campus process. Kellogg has offered some interesting alumni events in major cities since graduation as well.",,,
Northwestern,GMAT Club,"International student, applied to Kellogg with a goal to work in consulting the US after graduation, so far school provides tremendous resources ( both the career management center and from the student body) for you to (1) succeed in interviewing, (2) integrate seamlessly into the US culture.

Moreover, being a campus-centric school and having a strong communal spirit, Kellogg provides ample opportunities to make new friends.

Finally, a mix of core classes and flexible curriculum ensures that first, everybody is put on the base required level of business knowledge, and second, everyone is able to tailor their education to support their professional aspirations - be it entrepreneurship, healthcare or tech.",,,
Northwestern,GMAT Club,"Kellogg really is the teamwork and marketing school you hear about. Students run everything and are generally very intelligent, outgoing and helpful in all aspects of student life. The vibe is very diverse and inclusive.

Social events start the school year with a frenzy, but as the the first year continues school work and especially recruiting begin to take a bulk of the time and attention of the students. Second year students generally are more laid back, especially after securing their full-time offer.

Classes are challenging if you're coming from a non-traditional background, and easier if you've spent the bulk of your career in a quantitative field. Professors are excellent and available if you want to face-time beyond class. Some people don't take classes very seriously, while others are dying for A's.

The toughest part of the experience is managing time. People told me how hard it would be to balance everything before coming here, but you REALLY feel that once you're here. It's not quite possible to fully prepare for it, but rather just accept it as a way of life, particularly in the first half of the first year. It gets easier.

For careers, the career center is as helpful as you want them to be -- to get the most out of them you have to be smart and strategic about which events you go to and who you talk to. The clubs (Tech Club, Marketing Club, Consulting Club, etc.) are more helpful overall for careers, in particular the guidance from second year students. You will be prepared for your interviews if you put in the time and effort and sit down with enough second years.

Overall, it's a fantastic school. Getting an MBA isn't easy a top school like this, but the rewards are plentiful in all walks of life. You get out of it what you are willing to put in.",,,
Northwestern,GMAT Club,"Kellogg has been really great so far. I have been looking forward to business school for a very long time and this has far surpassed my expectations and I am pinching myself every so often to make sure this is real life. The student body is diverse and it is incredible to hear the stories of my classmates- they are so accomplished! One thing I would like to underline for future applicants is how large the class size is. This can be overwhelming at times, whether you are trying to sign up for social events or trying to get some focused career guidance. That being said, this is definitely offset by the huge network you have access to and the number of people you are able to meet.

Professors are great, really care about building relationships with the students, despite the large class size.

Tech is becoming extremely popular at Kellogg, second only to consulting. All of the big tech companies (Apple, Amazon, Microsoft, Google, etc) recruit here on campus but the competition is pretty steep.",,,
Northwestern,GMAT Club,"Overall, Kellogg is a great school and I´m happy I decided to come here. The fact that it´s located in Evanston is actually a great plus for me. Since it´s a small town you never have to walk more than 20 minutes to meet for a group project, and if you want to enjoy the perks of a big city the Metra will take you to Chicago in about 30 minutes.

One thing that could be improved is the fact that most events are planned with a fairly limited capacity. This year more than 100 students were left out of the popular ski trip because there wasn´t enough capacity to accommodate.",,,
Northwestern,GMAT Club,"I would recommend Kellogg to anyone who is not dead-set on pursuing a career in investment banking. The student body and culture are Kellogg's greatest asset. Everyone is genuinely nice and willing to help you out. As someone who had an alternative career path the career center was pretty much worthless. I had a very meetings with an advisor but received little feedback and no referrals to potential employers. I received my offer late in the year and at that time it seemed like all they cared about was that I had a job not that it was the right job for me. I was underwhelmed but some of the professors. The good ones usually cost a lot of bid points. Many are too research focused and have no touch with the real word. The ones who came out of industry were fantastic and I wish all business school, not just Kellogg, would move more in that direction.",,,
Northwestern,GMAT Club,"Kellogg was the perfect school for me: challenging and inspiring curriculum; diverse, supportive classmates who remain some of my best friends; a perfect location on a traditional campus but right near a major city; and incredible opportunities for personal development on a very student-driven campus. I would advise applicants to cover both their career and academic successes and their character/cultural fit. I've known people who had incredible professional experience but haven't gotten in for cultural fit reasons.

Northwestern,GMAT Club,"Kellogg has done a great job meeting and exceeding my expectations. Kellogg is providing far more than just a stamp on my resume. All of the classes I've taken thus far have been engaging and I've picked up skills that I will be able to apply on day one of my internship/job as well as skills, such as Organizational Behavior, that will prove invaluable to me throughout my career.

The career center has been useful for teaching the basics about recruiting/interviewing, but as at any top program, the most helpful source of information comes from 2nd year students and alumni, who have been incredibly supportive of me thus far. My first year counterparts are also remarkably driven and intelligent, which can be quite intimidating until you realize how friendly and collaborative they all are.

My only complaint is that the classes might be too much work, which has thus far diluted my efforts to really focus on my career and networking, although I'm sure this will all even out after I get my internship in the spring.

We lost 2 all-star professors this year to other schools, but the caliber of all the professors with whom I have taken classes thus far have been quite high, so I have no complaints.

Outside of a few PE/VC/Rotation Programs, which only recruit at Harvard/Stanford, all of the blue-chip companies that you want to be a part of recruit at Kellogg or have alumni that would be more than willing to help you land a job there.",,,
Northwestern,GMAT Club,"Great professors, amazingly freindly and warm student body, someone 10 years out told me it would be the best 2 years of my life, I did not believe him as lilfe has treated me fairly well, but he was right. The level of comradery you feel is through the roof.

It's a large enough school where you can find your groove and your favorite type of people and then form friends for life.

Best advice? Take out full loans and prepare your travel budgets. People are very down the earth, especially about travel, but you are going to want to do it all. I think I went to 20+ countries with my classmates and each one was more amazing than the next. Traveling together with so many brilliant classmates was a once in a lifetime experience.",,,
Northwestern,GMAT Club,"I truly believe that the quality of education is pretty comparable at any of the top schools. Given that, I chose Kellogg over other schools due to its collaborative atmosphere, student leadership opportunities, and collegial nature. I'm happy to say that I wasn't wrong about any of these. Even in recruiting, when two of us were going for the same positions at the same office locations, we helped each other, connecting each other with recruiters we might have missed or people we weren't able to network with. And when it came to student leadership, it was unparalleled. The amount of responsibility and leverage you have as a club leader, a student government leader, an event leader, or any other position is truly insane. My only complaint about that is that at times I wish the administration and other Kellogg staff helped the student leaders more and were more proactive instead of reactive (waiting for students to ask them to do something) — it was sometimes like having a full-time job in addition to your studies. If you're an extrovert, Kellogg is for you. Especially the social scene. If you're in introvert, it'll be tougher; I won't lie. But it can still be a very enjoyable experience, especially when people are friendly and willing to help.

Also, Kellogg LOVES diversity, including people from non-business/non-traditional career backgrounds. However, if you are one of these people, you will probably have a little more trouble in your classes and in recruiting. It's frustrating, especially, in recruiting because companies will be very interested in talking to you (because you're not the 15th ex-consultant they've met) but they'll test you harder in interviews and often choose a candidate with a more traditional background over you, all things being relatively equal. This is probably true of any business school you go to, though.

There's a ton of group work. And although this isn't everyone's cup of tea, I think it's an important skill to have. You're going to have to deal with it when you go back into your career — this lets you improve your leadership skills, your coping mechanisms, and your communication.

If you're going for a traditional avenue — consulting, CPG marketing, finance — Kellogg is very supportive, both from the student club side and the career office side. If you're going for something less traditional — media, sports, start-ups, net impact — it's going to be a little tougher. I know Kellogg continues making strides to help these non-traditional folks, but you will have to do a lot of your own legwork.",,,
Northwestern,GMAT Club,"It's my first time in the US as a full-time student, so I've only been blown away by the quality of education and the depth and breadth of resources.

1. Teaching quality - the quality of teaching far surpasses anything I've expected. I came not expecting much. I'd always been pretty good academically, but here, I've been challenged and stimulated. Even when class material is ""simple"", classmates have consistently elevated the level of learning.

2. Alumni support - alumni are just a phone call away. I don't know if it's the norm at all business schools, but my peers and I are never turned down when we call for help or information.

3. School support/brand recognition in job search - again, my first experience at an elite institution in the USA, and I don't know if it's the same at other schools. The access we get to top-notch employers is without par. Career services and the school's professional clubs also do well in regulating company contact time with students.

4. Environment - perhaps it's only the first quarter; we're not competing directly for jobs yet. So far, people are extremely supportive and helpful. No one withholds resources from another, people are always sharing information and help.",,,
Northwestern,GMAT Club,"*Got a top tier consulting internship, and ultimately full-time offer, without any prior consulting experience.

* Amazing student body. Everyone is super friendly and helpful. Very collaborative, instead of competitive. Welcome change from my undergrad days at NYU Stern, in which everyone was competitive and cold.

* Great school culture. Multiple Kellogg school events per week and lots of school spirit. Very diverse groups of people, and everyone will find a place to fit in. Definitely the most fun business school in the M7. When we have Kellogg versus Booth school events, literally 4 times Kellogg students attend than Booth students.

* Ton of options with classes, and you can choose to take anywhere between 3 and 5 credits per semester. So you can be lazy and take 3, and put your attention elsewhere (e.g. socially, extracurriculars, start-ups), or 5 every quarter if you value academics

* Have made countless close friends who I expect to still be close to a decade from now.

* Location is great. 30 minutes away from the city, so people tend to hang out with each other and develop strong bonds...but city is close enough that if you get bored it's easy to uber/train out there for cheap.

Great assortment of classes. If you go to a smaller school, you might miss some cool electives. For example, I'm interested in strategy and healthcare, and there's a ton of options.

Everyone recruits from this school. Whereas not everyone will get MBB, Google, GS (although a ton do), everyone can find a join that pays $120k base + quity + signing. People who take less money, or people who aren't employed at graduation have specific job goals (that either pay less, or do just-in-time hiring). If you're worried about finding a job, don't worry. Literally everyone who wants to be employed with a high paying job, is.",,,
Stanford,GMAT Club,"The professors are personally invested in the success of their students, and they are very approachable. They always respond very quickly to any emails sent to them directly. I have also had numerous opportunities to have individual or small group chats with many of my professors. Their connections with local industry and VC firms is amazing. My classmates are also fantastic. I can honestly say that I have not met a single person here who is not outright impressive yet kind! I am constantly blown away by the caliber of students here. They seem to effortlessly grasp difficult concepts and run with it to create new companies or setup up NGOs to solve societal problems. This is a group of doers and real-world problem solvers. I just feel so lucky to be here to learn and make amazing new friends who will be life-long friends.",,,
Stanford,GMAT Club,"This place is better than I expected...

Honestly, in trying to be incredibly critical, I have very little negative to share, and absolutely 0 substantial negatives to share. The professors, classmates, and facilities are incredible. I catch myself often in disbelief about what a diverse place this is, both in terms of the people here and the opportunities available.

To get more specific: there are classes on topics that are not only cutting edge, but often pushing the edge, especially in terms of leadership development and entrepreneurship. I often find myself having to choose between a great way to spend my time and an incredible way to spend my time.

A few examples: the GSB impact fund gives students a chance to invest real money in companies all the while learning what it takes to conduct due diligence on a company/building portfolio companies.

Another example of the network: since I have been here (just over 3 months), there have been numerous opportunities to work with alumni on interesting projects in new fields, where they would welcome fresh perspectives and encourage students using it as an opportunity to learn. I specifically got set up so I have a project this December in HI on a topic I am interested in but have no formal background in. Of course I am going to work my tail off, but the point is the network helped me find the opportunity.

There are many more examples, but most importantly I have come to realize how beautiful of a time this is to explore what are the things one wants to spend your life doing, and how to use business to help you do that (and hopefully help you help others to do the same).

**Finally, I want to make note that I am willing to help others by reviewing their essays. The ""What matters to you most and why"" question is something talked about a lot here, and I may be able to help you frame it so your message is clear. Reach out if interested and we can talk.**

Organization Behavior with Frank Flynn is an incredible class focused on how to make organizations effectively innovate, grow, and change.

Optimization and Modeling is a fantastic course. I leave it every week wondering how I moved through the business world without the skills it has taught me thus far.",,,
Stanford,GMAT Club,"I am continuously blown away by the caliber of students at the GSB. The student body is incredibly diverse, thoughtful, well-spoken, and down to earth. Getting to know and learn from my fellow students has been the most enlightening and inspirational component of the GSB student thus far.

The community for the MBA1s on campus creates a collaborative and social environment (esp. Highland/Schwab buildings). All of the facilities on campus are over-the-top nice.

The professors and classes have been excellent. Professors are well-prepared and most-classes are discussion-based, providing the chance to learn from others. There is some rigidity to the curriculum during the first year and the class scheduling process could use some improvement, but I think the administration is working on those details. The quarter system is great for providing more flexibility to your schedule and allowing you to explore more areas of interest.

Stanford,GMAT Club,"Stanford is a world class university located in the heart of Silicon Valley. The GSB is an exceptionally strong business education and is well integrated into the rest of the university. The defining strengths of the program are the people: fellow students, professors, and alumni. These profoundly capable and good natured people form a supportive yet ambitious culture. Students are charged both with finding and achieving our own personal brand of happiness (""what matters most to you and why?"") and to make our mark on the world after we graduate (""change lives, change organizations, change the world.""). There is incredible support to chart your own path and a wide variety of programs and diverse classmates/alumni who can help you get there. I 100% recommend choosing Stanford if you're fortunate enough to have the opportunity to attend.

Superb. Exceptional flexibility to create an academic program that fits your needs and interests. Very easy to enroll in multiple classes throughout the university (law, engineering, etc.) and still meet graduation requirements.

On campus recruiting is active here, but it probably has a lower emphasis than at other programs. That is partly because the GSB is a smaller class size and there is a strong emphasis on charting your own path (especially for entrepreneurs or into the technology industry). It is definitely the way to go for those interested in consulting, banking, or some of the larger employers (Starbucks, GM, etc.).",,,
Stanford,GMAT Club,"Stanford is a phenomenal school with a huge diversity in student population. The people define the school, who are all highly accomplished, with different backgrounds and yet humble enough to help each other out (ofcourse there will be few exceptions to this).
Besides the traditional career path, I would say the school is also for people who want to discover themselves, are not sure what they want to do next but explore several opportunities. But its very important to be yourself and not get carried away by what others are doing.

Suggestion to future applicants would be try to showcase who you truly are then a list of resume accomplishments. Thats what sticks with the school the most. Also once you get in, don't be on cloud 9 that you are only meant to change the world. You will be happier if you still expect reality on what the job market is out there, etc",,,
Stanford,GMAT Club,"The best part about Stanford is the culture and the people. The admissions process tries to weed out anybody that is arrogant or inwardly focused. The result is a culture that is non competitive and extremely supportive. For example, your classmates can bet the best source of career leads and information on new opportunities you are exploring. I have been blown away by how much people contribute to the community (planning events, etc.).

The opportunities within tech and entrepreneurship are also incredible. With close access to VCs in the area, a number of students are involved with part-time internships or entrepreneur in residence programs. The on-campus resources for start-ups are also expansive.

The school is very tech focused. While there is something for everyone here, it has been more tech centric than I expected.",,,
Stanford,GMAT Club,"As a recent alum, I can affirm that the GSB's reputation is well-earned. Highlights include:

- Tight-knit class of nice, down-to-earth, diverse students
- Strong brand with strong career opportunities
- Beautiful location and facilities
- Interesting coursework, particularly in 2nd year (more practitioners, niche electives, ability to enroll in courses in other Stanford departments, etc.)
- Relaxed culture (grade non-disclosure, no class Wednesdays, ample vacations/breaks)
- Significant travel/international experiences
- Strong focus on soft skills (Touchy Feely, presentation skills, etc.)
- Great exposure to CEOs/executives and leaders across industries (View from the Top, Executive Challenge, class speakers, etc.)

Stanford,GMAT Club,"So far I've only been here for 4 months but it's like fantasy land! Everything is just amazing (except for the weather which has been a little chillier than I would expected, that El ninio! )
You can actually burp to get an interview with whoever you want just because of the brand. My class is amazing, I would say that less than 1% of the entire class can be classified as ""Minor jerks"". Really lots of fun with everyone. Each day you get to meet and talk with other succesful CEOs and entrepreneurs, just amazing!
The curriculum is also super cool, you have both world class GSB classes and some ""across the street"" and d.school classes that are simply amazing",,,

Stanford,Niche,"Students are proactive, ambitious, sociable, and friendly. Strong focus on entrepreneurship and tech. Would have enjoyed a stronger emphasis on social responsibility and ethics.",,,
Stanford,Niche,"Stanford has been a great experience so far. I went through a bit of a rough patch early in my freshman year but once I became acclimated, I fell in love with the school and Northern California in general. Campus is absolutely beautiful and I would say that there is something going on ninety percent of the time. Most people are down to earth, good human beings who are genuine and pleasant to be around. I would like to see the dining situation change; myself and many other included believe that it is flawed and that unused dining swipes should be turned into dining dollars, portions should be larger, etc. Overall, however, Stanford is an amazing place.",,,
Stanford,Niche,"Attending Stanford has been a mix of excitement and challenges. Going to games is a blast, with plenty of sports activities. Professors are generally great but lean politically one way, limiting viewpoint diversity. As a research-focused institution, one-on-one time with professors is limited, though humanities professors are more approachable. Lecturers are decent, reflecting the research emphasis.

Campus life can be slow, so finding your group is crucial. The campus is huge and beautiful, with great weather and all necessary amenities. The social scene is limited, and Palo Alto, though affluent, is not very exciting. San Francisco and Oakland are 45 minutes to an hour away, offering more entertainment options. However, most students stay on campus due to the distance and heavy workload, contributing to the ""Stanford bubble."" Overall, Stanford offers great opportunities, but you need to find your niche to make the most of it.",,,
Stanford,Niche,"I will always love Stanford for the memories and the people I have met. Stanford, in many ways, is amazing--sunny all the time and a campus out of a magazine. What's special about attending an ""elite"" institution is the number of opportunities available--funding for projects, opportunities to travel for free, opportunities for publication, opportunities to work with leaders in your field and more. If you're looking for opportunity, you will find it at Stanford. What sucks about Stanford is probably what sucks at any other private institution in the country: change is slow, it seems like administrators don't care what students think or want, the financial aid department can ruin your day, there are a ton entitled white, rich kids here who pretend like they're not entitled, white rich kids. STEM will always have more opportunities than other fields; the influence of Silicon valley is prevalent.",,,

Stanford,Niche,"I absolutely loved Stanford—the campus is beautiful, the professors are passionate and inspiring, the students are interesting and like to have a good time, and the athletics program is one of the best in the country.

UChicago,GMAT Club,"Booth is a fantastic school for those who have a very clear sense of what they want to do. Between the flexible curriculum, ability to take classes in both the Harper and Gleacher center, and the strengths in a wide variety of subjects, the school is a great place for independent people and those who are naturally outgoing. However the school's strengths are also its drawbacks, namely there is not a very strong cohort system, and so one has to really go the extra mile to get to know ones classmates.

As somebody who was transitioning sectors within finance, I found that the classes and brand helped immensely. I was able to secure a private equity internship without any prior banking experience.

Advice I would give to future applicants: you should seriously consider Booth, it's a fantastic school and the ""where fun goes to die"" adage does not apply to the business school, only the undergraduate college.",,,
UChicago,GMAT Club,"Booth is a ""create your own adventure"" type business school. There's no cohort structure, and there's tons of freedom when choosing classes. This school is great for those who thrive with this unstructured academic and social approach.

The school gets all the basics right. Career services are good, and classes by and large are good. Banking, consulting, investment management and all the basic career paths are strong here. We also have private equity/venture capital too but it's a little harder to break into.

The one area which was disappointing, and why I could not give it a perfect rating, is the culture of the school. The culture isn't bad, but I do not believe it is as advertised. The school markets itself as a very intellectual, rigorous place. In my experience, there was a lot of platitudes and I never heard anything really interesting or thought-provoking. To the extent this culture exists, it's in the PhD program and academics, Booth's true strength area. The MBA program culture was pretty typical yuppie as far as I could tell.

Booth seems to have a strong presence in analytics, so if that's an area of interest the school is definitely worth checking out.

A lot of people end up having to do a ""specialized search"", meaning going for companies that do not recruit on campus. If you're looking for traditional big MBA employers like banking, consulting and tech, on-campus is fine. But most corporations, even some very large ones in the Chicagoland area, do not recruit at Booth directly. So if you're looking to work in a corporate function in Chicago post-graduation, that's something to be prepared for.",,,
UChicago,GMAT Club,"I had high expectations for Booth. The experience dramatically exceeded my expectations.

I expected to learn a ton. But the amount and pace of learning blew me away.

I expected awesome colleagues. Their deep kindness, altruism, wicked smartness blew me away.

I expected a great entrepreneurship education. I got one of the world's best entrepreneurship education and incubator programs. Super super super the real deal.

If you are looking for a program that holds your hand, Booth is not for you. At Booth, they put the weight on you to develop and drive your own experience. If you put energy into that, it's such a journey on which you'll grow more per day than anywhere else in your life.",,,
UChicago,GMAT Club,"The mantra of the University of Chicago Booth School of Business is it’s all about the idea. Students focus on generating, analyzing, comparing, and refining ideas in order to elevate them to better ideas.

The full-time MBA program consists of 20 classes plus Leadership Effectiveness and Development (LEAD). The flagship of the program is its flexible curriculum. Unlike many other top schools with lockstep first-year MBA programs, Booth does not require its MBAs to go through every class together. One key exception is the LEAD course, which all MBAs must take. However, by and large, students design a program tailored to fit their own career goals.",,,
UChicago,GMAT Club,"Every (successful) Booth applicant has likely heard about Booth's flexible curriculum, yet I can't stress enough how this ""we'll treat you like an adult and let you make your own choices"" philosophy can shape one's Booth experience. Personally, having worked in finance and completed the CFA program before Booth, I opted not to take the basic Investments and Accounting classes that would have been mandatory at peer institutions in favor of advanced finance (including PhD classes and a well-known bankruptcy/restructuring class at UChicago Law) and additional entrepreneurship coursework. I saw many classmates similarly take full advantage of the ability to pick and choose from a diverse course offerings to pursue their varied passion. This is not to say that academic is the dominant factor underlying a Booth experience; like other top MBA programs, we spent large chunks of our time exploring career options, preparing for and going through interviews, traveling, and of course, partying. But one shall not ignore how much whom you meet IN the classroom shape your MBA experience. I was fortunate to meet and become good friends with ""Boothies"" in my class as well as the classes immediately above and immediately below mine, many of which came from a wide variety of fascinating backgrounds. I became a better person because of knowing them.

Last but not least, Chicago's relatively low cost-of-living and the fact that >80% of Booth students live right in the heart of Chicago (with an easy train commute to school) mean that we all had a great time!",,,
UChicago,GMAT Club,"Depending on the area of focus/industry you are interested in, the school offers different sets of resources. For example, if you are interested in investment banking or consulting, there is a wealth of resources (current students, alumni, clubs) that are available to help pursue an internship or job in these areas. However, if you are interested in some of the less common professions like marketing or PE, then much more of the onus is put on you to guide your search. Booth still makes great efforts to help in these areas but it still lacks in comparison to others.

I would suggest coming into business school with a purpose and an idea of what industry/profession you want to pursue. Although the school does a great job of providing background in most areas, do your homework before coming in to get the most out of the resources provided. There are great social aspects that add to your experience, but not enough to justify the high price that business school costs.",,,
UChicago,GMAT Club,"Chicago Booth was extremely helpful for my career and the program fully met my expectations.

The student culture at Booth is amazing and students are very collaborative. Paying-it-forward is an important part of the mentality and students go to great lengths to help their classmates. Many students take leadership roles in student groups and help organize activities outside of school.

The academic experience is of highest quality and the flexible curriculum allows students to tailor the experience to their needs. Booth offers the option to take classes with world-class faculty but also offers opportunities for experiential learning in lab classes and internships. Students get flexibility and can choose between classes at the University of Chicago campus or at Booth's downtown Chicago facility.

Career services is highly professional and well-connected to industry. Firms recruit on-campus at modern interview facilities. All the major firms from key MBA industries (Consulting, Investment Banking, Tech) recruit talent from Chicago Booth.

Chicago is a great location for an MBA degree. The city offers all the restaurants and culture of a major city and has many interesting neighborhoods. Housing prices are affordable in comparison to other major cities with many housing options in modern high-rise apartment buildings downtown. The city is also well connected with direct flights to many cities in the U.S. and across the globe – very helpful for recruiting or leisure travel.

UChicago,GMAT Club,"I have loved my time at the school, but I wish the school had more options on the career portal and I wish that they were more proactive in assisting with the recruiting process. I am working in MBB consulting this summer, but would have been cool to explore some amazing internships via the career portal (I know that HBS has many more options). There are also some career paths (e.g. Private equity) which are nearly impossible to get from Booth.

Cirriculum and professors are first rate, as is the student body. There is a culture of helping students in the year beneath you, which I greatly appreciated when preparing for interviews. I do wish the campus were downtown - Hyde Park is not a desirable location.",,,
UChicago,GMAT Club,"Phenomenal program for investment banking (speaking from personal experience), from academic preparation to career services and student body support/guidance throughout the recruiting process
Academic/Course Selection flexibility enabled me to challenge myself (undergraduate finance/marketing major)
Greater than expected diversity of personalities, backgrounds, and thought
Amazing culture of paying it forward (more than expected)
Social flexibility to create your own unique experience by getting involved with areas of interest to you; academic flexibility encourages you to interact with different people based on the classes you choose (also leads to better integration between 1st and 2nd year students)",,,
UChicago,GMAT Club,"It has really met all of my expectations an exceeded most. My main goal was career oriented and Booth (along with all other top tier schools) offers so many opportunities in so many areas. Even in not-traditionally-Booth areas like marketing or tech, there are tremendous opportunities on campus and the booth name goes far.

I would suggest to future applicants to definitely go to Booth, specifically if you're interested in quant or math coursework. I chose to come here because I wanted to learn the hardest material if I was going to take 2 years off of work. Grade nondisclosure helps with this, and the open curriculum allows you to take whatever. Based on my internship nd conversations, it sounds like the opportunities are the same everywhere in the top 7, but Booth's real differentiator is the rigor of classes and the openness of coursework.

Professors are so hit or miss, especially in required courses. Also, 2/3 of the classes may be horse fudge (any class about leadership, any class about managerial decision making, etc). I learned this and only took classes that I needed the support to thrive, such as big data or financial time series or PHD classes. Don't pay over 6k for a class that is a glorified leadership self help book taught by a low level academic dweeb who has no real leadership skills.",,,
UChicago,GMAT Club,"A few highlights of Booth:
- Supportive (and large) student group. Focus on community and helping future Boothies via the ""pay-it-forward"" culture. This focus continues to engage students for a great experience while at Booth and continues to grow the brand.
- Incredible professors and academics on faculty
- Flexible curriculum allows you to study at your own pace and to your own interests/needs
- Most Boothies live in downtown Chicago (take the train to Hyde Park for class). A lot of fun social events, Chicago is a great city to spend your B-School years
- Career Services is highly successful and supportive in ensuring students receive both internship and full time job offers. Career focused student groups also incredibly critical to getting students placed.",,,
UChicago,GMAT Club,"I'm a first year Booth MBA student (full-time) and I will focus this brief review on the things I was surprised by the most.

1. Pay it forward culture
As a first year, the amount of support you receive from second years is astounding. For example, if you're recruiting for consulting, second years are not only willing to help you prepare, but they will actively engage you - you don't even really need to seek them out. This ""pay it forward"" mentality extends to other aspects, and it's very evident it continues when you become an alumnus. I'm looking forward to giving back by helping out first years and future students when I'm an alum.

2. Professors
Ok, so maybe it's because I had a poor undergraduate experience, but I'm blown away by some of the professors. No, basic accounting has not been revolutionized at Booth, but some/many courses have professors who are amazing presenters and who deliver cutting edge courses because they're at the top of their respective fields.

3. Career services/recruitment
I didn't expect recruitment opportunities to be so organized. If you are recruiting for the most common industries (consulting, banking, etc.) there is an incredibly sophisticated infrastructure to guide you through the process. What's more amazing is just how accessible the top firms are - once they arrive on campus, you'll get to know everybody.",,,
UChicago,GMAT Club,"The support for job search, for both summer internship and full time, is exceptional and backed by the professionals in the Career Sevices Office as well as by fellow students who volunteer through a structure support program.

The curriculum is extremely challenging and allows for extensive development of both soft skills and quant skills. The ability to study under professors such as Eugene Fama is something that I have truly enjoyed.

The students within the program are all very supportive of each other in the classroom and during the job search.

The social life is amazing. Lots of trips around the world you can sign up for as well as student groups that plan a wide range of activities around the city. For students coming with significant others, the Booth Partners Club is the best thing ever. It's a group specially designed for partners of students that organize events throughout the year. Events include fun activities to make friends and explore the city as well as job searching support for partners. This is really helpful since the student will be very busy with school and recruiting. The Partners Club makes the partners feel like they are part of the Booth B-School experience as well.

Added bonus: Living in downtown Chicago is the best. Affordable apartments compared to other large metro areas with lots to do and an endless amount of great restaurants.",,,
UChicago,GMAT Club,"Overall, Booth is a great school for those who like to think analytically. Flexible curriculum and excellent faculty are fortes. The career services is very good and is one of the few programs that let's you opt for in campus recruiting. Overall, I had a wonderful experience and it definitely helped me gain the career traction that I was looking for. Furthermore the alumni network is strong and widely spread across the globe, making it easy to look for opportunities anywhere in the world. The brand name name and reputation further helps in gaining opportunities. Feel free to reach out me if you have any questions.",,,
UChicago,GMAT Club,"Booth is a pretty incredible place, but it is a unique environment that is best suited for those who are comfortable dealing with ambiguity and driven by intellectual curiosity.

The biggest factors that made me decide to attend Booth were:

(1) The flexible curriculum: I didn't appreciate this as much until I actually got into the program; it is incredible to choose what courses to take, what professors to have, and even what days of the week you want class.
(2) Student culture: If I had to sum it up, it would be the ""pay-it-forward culture"" -- 2Ys help 1Ys more than any program I have heard of. They help with everything from selecting classes to helping with interview prep. Since you take classes together (see #1), you build deeper relationships between classes.
(3) ""Challenge everything"": this is a motto of the school and it resonates within the classroom -- if you aren't challenging someone's ideas, then you're doing them a tremendous disservice.
(4) Chicago is an awesome city: the main campus is down in Hyde Park, but 80%+ students live in downtown Chicago (the 'Loop') closer to the Gleacher Center (Chicago Booth downtown campus). It would be better if the main campus was right down town, but by everyone coming together in HP, it creates a pretty cool student experience.
(5) Brand / rankings (if I am being honest).

Even with all these high expectations, the full-time experience exceeded them in almost every capacity. The support that you receive -- from the school, from second-years, and from your classmates is incredible. They never ""get you a job"" or ""tell you what classes to take"", but they're there to answer questions every step along the way.

If there was one thing I would recommend future applicants to do -- it'd be to figure out what makes Chicago Booth unique, and really ask yourself whether or not it's a good fit for you. A lot of people simply apply to the ""top 5"" schools, but the differences in culture, curriculum, and ""focus"" (whether it is social, academic, professional, etc.) can be stark. Do the ""soul searching"" before / while you apply to schools... not after you've made the decision.

Career placement is second to none -- every major company (consulting, IB, IM, and tech) recruits on campus. If anything, I think Booth's technology placement and entrepreneurship programs are underrated to its peers.",,,
UChicago,GMAT Club,"For me Bschool is about taking two years to do what you normally wouldn't, socialize with people you would never even think to say hello to, or try a new working environment. I will readily say that Booth was not the school that felt like home to me. However, I did like the intellectual energy I felt in Harper Center, the advice I'd received from alums, and the positive endorsements about career services.

One of the questions that I am often asked about Booth from prospective students and recent admits is, ""If there are no cohorts and students live all over Chicago does Booth really have much of a community?"" I've also repeatedly read comments like, ""the flexible curriculum does not allow for bonding,"" and ""Booth is a commuter school."" So does Chicago Booth have much of a community? I think that there are two main ways to define a school's community: tight-knit and engaged. I will say upfront that Booth does not have a tight-knit community. However, I would argue that neither do schools like Kellogg and Wharton (both of which are known for having strong communities). When people say a school's students are tight-knit they often are saying that everybody knows one another. I'd argue that when any class has more than 400 students it's impossible for the students to be tight-knit by that definition. So then if a school isn't tight-knit by the above definition does that mean that it does not have a strong community? Of course not! The biggest misconception is that Booth students are dispersed all over Chicago. The fact is that over 80% of students live within a 2 mile strip of the downtown neighborhoods the Loop, South Loop, and Streeterville. Heck, over 60% of students live in three buildings that are often referred to as the dorms (Millenium Park Plaza, Columbus Plaza, MDA). Just because Booth students do not live in close proximity to the school does not mean that they don't live in close proximity to one another.

Now let me address the lack of cohorts. Technically, Booth does have cohorts. Cohorted learning is only in place for Booth's one required course, LEAD, which takes place during orientation and the first 4 weeks of the first quarter. After LEAD there are a few big cohort based activities like Golden Gargoyles and Leadership Challenge, but for the most part cohort activities are spearheaded by cohort members and the graduate business council (i.e. cohort trivia, cohort t-shirt day, etc.). Although students aren't required to be at these events there is always a very healthy turnout. I think this illustrates the beauty that is Booth. At it's core this place is an exercise in free markets. Everything is driven by students' choices and Booth students choose to be actively involved with the school. Even without the typical structures to build school loyalty and student body engagement, students are so tied to Booth we often struggle to excoriate ourselves from the ""Booth Bubble."" There is more activity going on at Booth than any person can keep track of and the majority of it is student run. Booth students choose to invest their time in making sure this community is thriving. There is an overflow of people clamoring to participate in admit weekend, career services, admissions, and more. Oftentimes these activities require hours of work and we still want to do it. I think this speaks volumes to the ties people have to Booth.

I will readily admit that although Booth has a very vibrant community it is built differently than at other schools. In allowing people to pick their classes, schedule, and professors it's very much so a choose your own adventure kind of place. Booth fosters breadth of socializing, but it's up to the individual to determine where to seek depth. One of the best consequences of this breadth is a greater sense of cohesion between the 1st & 2nd year classes. This is the very opposite of the structure at most schools where the depth of socializing is built into the program and it's up to students to seek out a wider breadth. Truth be told the breadth was difficult for me at first. I felt that I was meeting a lot of people but not really forming deeper relationships. It wasn't until ski trip when I had a week of consistent socializing with people that I started really making friends. The opportunities to really bond with people are all over the place at Booth. However, it might take a little patience and being proactive to figure out what those opportunities are for you.

I will tell any prospective student how much I love being here, but I will also say that it isn't for everybody. If you really like structure and aren't looking to try something different then Booth isn't the school for you. If you tend not to be proactive in getting to know people then you probably shouldn't be here. However, if the bevvy of choice appeals to you or you want to try a social environment that is different from what you're used to then this might could be the place for you.",,,
UChicago,GMAT Club,"I had an amazing experience at Booth. The program and culture live up to the mantras of ""Challenge everything"" and ""Independent thought"" in my experience. Personally, I was drawn to the fact that there is no one path at Booth -- you're not forced into a cohort, you're not told which classes you have to take, you're not assigned to study teams and instead, you have the freedom to chart your own course (within some guidelines of course!) and you gain much wider exposure (e.g., taking classes with 2nd years). Looking back, the LEAD course was extremely helpful and I apply those lessons about leadership and self-awareness everyday now. The student culture is very strong (and different than what many perceive) -- it's a bit different from other schools where there's a concentrated campus that everyone lives near and again, things aren't dictated for you. I was incredibly impressed by my classmates -- not just their intelligence and career drive but also their passion for traveling and experiencing the city of Chicago. I did not find it to be competitive at all - I think because of the grade non-disclosure but also in recruiting, I had so much help from my classmates.",,,
UChicago,GMAT Club,"For a career in finance, I think it's common knowledge that Booth is top. What people often don't realize is how well the school also does in marketing, tech and consulting (McKinsey, Apple and Kraft are top employers). I went the traditional finance route into investment banking and don't think there is a better choice for it ( including even Wharton). Booth bankers are all over the Street and in Silicon Valley at all the top banks, and they command a lot of respect.

Culturally, the school has really improved its atmosphere through the LEAD program and number of clubs and activities. It also allows students a great deal of independence and freedom to choose the friends and teammates they want without forcing anything (in true Friedman form). Finally you have th opportunity to live in on of the most underrated cities in the US, Chicago. It is better than Boston and Philly by a long shot and even New Yorkers enjoyed the break.",,,
UChicago,Niche,"All the basic elements of a business school were fantastic. This includes the classes, the career center, the facilities, the location, and the plethora of activities (career & fun) available at the school. If you go here, you won't be disappointed with any of the essentials. MBA students mostly go to school to get a job, and Booth does not disappoint. I will point out, however, location matters a little bit here. If you want to live in Chicago Booth is great. If not somewhere else may be slightly easier.

Why only four out of five stars? Well, the student life wasn't always perfect. There's no cohort system like other schools so its easy to get overwhelmed by the mass of people. Having grown up in Chicago, it was honestly easier to go back to the friends I had before than sort through 600 folks. And, while I was looking for an intellectual culture, it was a bit disappointing there too. Political views were uniform, and folks generally weren't intellectually curious beyond career.",,,
UChicago,Niche,"The academic environment at the University of Chicago is undoubtedly excellent. Although I haven’t officially started classes yet, various departments and institutions have already sent numerous emails inviting me to participate in informal academic activities. My peers are also very enthusiastic about academics, with several already preparing to host seminars or smaller-scale academic discussions — and as I just said, classes haven’t even officially started yet!

However, safety is a downside to the school. During my first week in Chicago, the sounds of police sirens outside my window never truly stopped. According to the campus safety app, there were six incidents of gun violence in the nearby streets on one particular day. While the areas where students typically stay are relatively safe, violent gang activity does occur just a few blocks away. Sometimes, you may need to pass through these areas when running errands or traveling, and trust me, you can never be too cautious.",,,
MIT,GMAT Club,"As a first year, I have been surprised by the sheer amount of resources and opportunities that are available to all students, such as the incredible entrepreneurial ecosystem. If you are interested in something, there will be a way for you to do it - whether it's starting your own FinTech startup through FinTech Ventures, completing an internship with a company through PM Lab, or even taking a coding class within the MIT engineering community.
Please share about the school, career services, and student life. My favorite part of the program has to be the students and my classmates - people have such diverse backgrounds and interests and are incredibly collaborate and supportive of each other, whether it's your core team doing accounting homework together, or prepping for a case interview, people are always willing to help. When I was applying for my MBA, I wanted to be part of a program that was on the smaller side and where I could become close to my cohort. With ~400 students per year, it's been a great experience always having the opportunity to meet new people, but still know a large majority of people in the class.

The professors are incredibly well-respected and leaders in their field. It's inspiring to take classes with them and become close with them, which is very common at Sloan. In addition, there are a wide selection of courses within Sloan (and across MIT and Harvard, where you are welcome to take classes as well!). Even though Sloan is not officially a ""non-grade-disclosure"" program, it's very hard to get lower than a B if you put in some effort into the class. However, I find that the emphasis on in-person classes/lack of flexibility for students missing classes for recruiting to be a surprise and an area for improvement.
",,,
MIT,GMAT Club,"MIT Sloan has been an exceptional experience and exceeded my expectations in supporting my career change from Military to Consulting.

I initially dismissed MIT in my MBA applications as too ""technical."" However, as I spoke to more people, applied, and have spent the past year here I feel that MIT excels in all technical and analytics topics while not compromising on traditional management education.

Career/Recruiting
My goal entering MIT was to enter consulting in the short term and prepare for international management in Asia. To that end, I took a broad curriculum in all management basics, with a specialization in business analytics through Sloan's new Analytics certificate. For results, Sloan's Asian Business Conference led me to intern at an outstanding Japanese company as their first ever MBA intern, and earn a full-time offer at a Management Consulting firm. I have found that the formula of my military (interpreted as high soft skills) combined with cutting-edge analytics training at MIT (about as technical as it gets in business) generates immediate interest from most executives with whom I have interviewed.

Culture:
Hands-down, Sloan has the top 2-3 cultures among all MBA programs. Students and alumni are high-quality, close-knit, ultra-supportive, and excited about Sloan. When connecting with alumni in firms or industries of interest, I have close to a 100% response rate. Culture is definitely more casual at Sloan compared to other top programs; it's very much a t-shirt/button-down results-over-appearance culture.

About professors, classes and curriculum
Strengths:
1) Access to the ENTIRE MIT ecosystem for classes.
2) Anything Analytics, Artificial Intelligence, Data Science related.
3) System Dynamics (it was invented here)
4) Operations: Logistics, Supply Chain, etc...

Management staples: Finance, Accounting, Marketing etc..are universally high quality but I wouldn't say that they are ground-breaking or a special strength.

Weaknesses:
Leadership: Limited curriculum and less focus on the students future role as leaders of large companies. In general, Sloan seems not to be viewed as a general management program.

Outstanding placement in consulting and tech. Most people (80%+) that wanted a consulting offer seemed to get at least one of their top 5 firms. That being said, MBB is still very tough here and I estimate no more than 40% of people who recruited for consulting got an MBB offer.

Tech: Amazon is the strongest tech firm on campus (around 10-20 people headed there I believe). To some degree Google (around 5 full-time offers I believe), while Facebook doesn't really come up very often. Tesla has also recently started recruiting here and will take some full-time folks.

Entrepreneurship: If you want to do a start-up or join one, the sky's the limit here. Extremely strong alumni network into startups and the Martin Trust Center for Entrepreneurship with Bill Aulet is an outstanding starting point for getting into startups.

Finance: Full Disclosure: Didn't participate in finance recruiting myself. Some of the main banks come here but finance is less popular at Sloan as a rule. For some people, this is an advantage as there is less competition for slots but there are also a few top banks that don't come here because of the smaller student body and reduced level of interest. Still, academically, there is a strong history of finance learning at Sloan and my finance oriented classmates are very satisfied with their learning.",,,
MIT,GMAT Club,"The first semester at MIT Sloan School of Management exceeded my initial expectations. What I valued the most of these first 6 months is the people I met. Everyone is extremely collaborative and supportive. If applying to consulting, there is a great community of both first and second years that will dedicate a lot of time to helping others. Another thing I loved is the innovative and technology driven culture. There is always something new going on around campus and most things are free for every student to access. ",,,
MIT,GMAT Club,"The classmates are very humble and friendly. You will work with a core team of 7 members in the first semester.

The school has a ton of resources if you want to start your own company. For the recruiting, it has a very structured process for IBD, consulting and technology. Sloan is the target school for all major consulting firms and investment banks. The competition for IBD jobs is significantly less intense than peer schools as there are less applicants.

In terms of the academic, you can choose up to 3 courses in either Harvard or other departments from MIT. And the one-semester core really helps me to customize my MBA experience.",,,
MIT,GMAT Club,"MIT Sloan is the business school for people who have hesitations about joining an environment of Type A, hyper-competitive students -- something business schools have unfortunately become known for. This is supported by three driving forces:

1) Admissions intentionally selects to create a down-to-earth culture
2) No strong requirement (but introspection still required!) to know your career path post-MBA
3) Sloan is always humbled by the engineering presence in the entire context of MIT

Starting with the culture, the famous Rod Garcia, who has led the MIT Sloan admissions team for longer than almost any other business school, is known and highly respected for his ability to pick the right candidates to fill the seats at MIT Sloan. The result is a cohort of humble (instead of proud), collaborative (instead of competitive) and accomplished (although you wouldn't know it if you met them at a party) students. This means, despite lack of non-grade disclosure, the cohort is more than willing to share with everyone else, maximizing learning and development opportunities for everyone. The cohort is encouraged to be proud of being the best ""team"" material, based on the thesis that teams, not individuals, are what drive business and action in the real world.

In an environment that does not start with a facetious post MBA goal, everyone is encouraged to take risks, with no baggage or excuses, further contributing to the shared struggle and culture described above.

In a way, this culture is necessary, in an environment such as MIT that is so dominated by the engineering schools, who will always remain skeptical of the business school students. The culture goes a long way in connecting these faculties, and can claim to have one of most well integrated entrepreneurship centers, reaching across Sloan and engineering rather than in individual silos.

However, this culture does not come without its opportunity costs. While the focus is internal, and maximises the enrichment of the student cohort, it does not perform as strong at representing and boasting its advantages to the public. As a result, Sloan probably ranks 1-3 spots below where it belongs on most business school rankings, if that matters to you. But it doesn't seem to matter to the students who apply and are ultimately accepted into Sloan's collaborative culture.

The one-semester Core is a great common bonding experience for the whole class, and is brief enough to provide space for 3 semesters of electives. However, the challenge of staffing the core subjects with enough high quality lecturers diminishes the experience of Core subjects. This is in stark contrast to my experience with elective subjects, which have a very high quality. Part of this challenge could be mitigated by streaming students or allowing waivers from certain subjects -- for example, all students need to take economics, accounting or statistics even if they have majored in it.
",,,
MIT,GMAT Club,"Two things have made my experience at Sloan great: 1) the fantastic culture embodied by the student community and 2) the variety of interests and expertise available at MIT.

Students here take their learning seriously but don't take themselves too seriously. You will find that there are few if any ""hidden agendas"" when it comes to collaboration and group work. People are genuinely interested in your personal experiences and look to learn from their peers.

Additionally, there's a lot of cool stuff happening at MIT. I don't think this needs much explanation. What's even better is that there's a constant push to commercialize all this cool shit, so the entrepreneurship environment is hopping and there's a lot of seed money to be spent with very low hurdles for grants.",,,
MIT,GMAT Club,"There is literally so many things to do, I barely sleep. I am currently working on couple of school project with REAL companies internationally as well as working with different clubs and conferences.
People are super humble and smart, a little bit nerdy!
We al dream to become entrepreneurs and think about long-term future.
We are excited about technology and new trends.
We partner closely with other schools and take classes there. Cambridge/Boston is a great location!

As you come to Sloan make sure you get involved in as many activities as you possibly can. Meet new people and be open to new ideas. You never know where will Sloan take you. Try to get executive positions in school clubs, organize conferences and take part in case competitions.",,,
MIT,GMAT Club,"Going into Sloan I had 4 main objectives -
- Transition from tech consulting into product management
- Relocated to the west coast after business school
- Bridge gaps I had domain knowledge related to leadership, finance and marketing
- Improve on my domain knowledge related to technology

MIT is a great choice to transition into a more technical career post business school. As an MBA student at MIT, you can take up to 3 classes outside of MIT Sloan to broaden your skills - taking classes at the MIT Media Lab or Computer Science Department is common among students in the program.

MIT Sloan has about 20% of their alumni base in the Ba Area so it was easy to imagine leveraging the MIT alumni network out in the bay area post business school.

MIT Sloan has 1 required core semester with the remaining 3 semester free to fill your schedule with a broad range of electives to fill any gaps you may have or double down on any areas of interest.

MIT afforded excellent recourses to take a deeper dive with technology with a number of clubs and events inside of Sloan and within the greater MIT to build more tech domain expertise.",,,
MIT,GMAT Club,"What is special about MIT?
a. The spirit of MIT – the university has a soul, and for me that was the most amazing thing
b. Focus on entrepreneurship, being a hub of innovation and out-of-the-box thinking not only from the MBA classmates but also the brilliant minds from the engineering schools
c. No peer pressure to join stereotypical MBA jobs like consulting or ibanking, a lot of new ideas and pursuits are encouraged
d. Focus on team work
e. Tolerance for failure

As for the atmosphere in the school, there is a palpable sense of mutual respect and admiration amongst all students, no one is ranked or called out for either being from a wealthy background or having certain brands on their resume. The students love the way in which selection process happens and assume there must be something wonderful about everyone who is there. Sloan is not transactional. There is no fee for every mixer or interaction, a lot of things are school sponsored and encourage everyone to come out and get to know each other and do stuff together.

As for the area, Cambridge is a university town. Lots of brilliant young minds, the vibe is very young, entrepreneurial, energetic and optimistic. Accommodation is expensive but unaffordable. Boston/Cambridge has a nice cultural vibe. Lots of art events to attend, very pro-diversity and liberal. Winters are cold and snowed under but its not windy like Chicago so its quite beautiful if you ask me.

Who will enjoy the program?
Someone who is liberal, looking for a genuinely engaging experience versus just doing bschool as a resume check point. Someone with an inquisite mind and proactive nature and doesn’t expect to be spoon fed or handheld all the time. Folks with a passion for innovation, entrepreneurship and technology will do very well here. Those who need structures not so well.

Faculty is all about high thinking. Focus is on bringing out the essence of a concept, encourage open debate and discussion, provide a spectrum of perspectives. Assignments and learning are for the most part meaningful and relevant. If you don’t like a class, you can opt out late into the semester and it won’t reflect on your academic record which is just wonderful.


Saying you are from MIT or MIT Sloan opens almost every door. Its really upto how focused, proactive and determined you are
Career office is very good when it comes to consulting, finance, tech and increasingly marketing jobs. They organize a lot of workshops, coaching sessions etc. Very helpful.
Career office not that great in traditionally non-MBA sectors like media entertainment, fashion, etc.

MIT,Niche,"MIT has great academics. It’s located near Boston so it is around a lot of places and other colleges. However the weather is scuffed. Also MIT’s campus is um…. Not pretty (to say the least). You definitely have to go out of your way to find fun things on campus— fun does not come to you. Some students have a hard time at MIT, especially mentally. Personally I’m not in tune with my emotions enough to let MIT get me down, but it’s very common at such a school.",,,
MIT,Niche,"Public transportation in Boston is a mixture of things. The T (or MBTA) is the subway/bus system in Boston. It will take you to many places within the metro-Boston area, including the suburbs (where I grew up), thus offering many opportunities to easily explore the many neighborhoods and suburbs in Boston. The cost is a bit steeper than what it used to be, but it's fine, I suppose. You can easily take the T to Boston Logan International Airport (BOS) so there's not much need for taxis unless you have a flight at some wee-hour of the night/morning when the T doesn't run. Yes, that is a problem. The T doesn't run very late, so you can't go out at night and stay out very very late if you plan to return home without a taxi. Another thing about the T is that it is notorious for not being on time, especially the Green Line (the subway/trolley line) and the buses.",,,
MIT,Niche,"Boston is not known for its good weather. Outside of early fall and late spring, you will be experiencing rain, snow, and more rain and snow. It's also very finicky. One second, it could be sunny. The next, it could be cloudy and potentially rainy. The summer is extremely hot (due to the humidity). But this is not to say there aren't good days. There are, it's just they're usually less frequent. There is a running joke that whenever we invite pre-frosh to CPW (Campus Preview Weekend), we turn on our weather machine.

MIT,Niche,"The Boston-Cambridge area has one of the best integrated transportation systems anywhere in the country. It is easy and relatively inexpensive to utilize the subways and busses that make up the T system, and there are also many cabs and other busses that one can take to get anywhere off of the main route that the T takes. Most things that one needs can be found within walking distance of a T station, although in winter a couple blocks might still seem like a trip to the North Pole and back. The biggest issue with transport in the area is if you might want to take a car with you to school. For the most part this will turn out to be completely unnecessary as most students will inform you. Parking can be expensive and hard to find and the roads can be difficult and confusing. If you don't plan on taking a car to school, there is no need to worry about transportation. If you do plan on taking a car, forget it and you'll have one less thing to worry about.",,,

They don't dress particularly well - half the year is brutally cold winter weather, so jeans and Northface coats are in heavy circulation most of the year. The 'work hard play hard' culture makes it difficult to have any type of casual relationships. Hookups and serious relationships are generally the only two options.",,,
MIT,Niche,"My existence at MIT has been almost constant stress. A relentless workload, grades that don't reflect the amount of effort I put into studying, and brutal weather for about 3/4 of the year. However, this environment also fosters the development of amazing friendships. MIT is like no other place in the world and you need to find a close group of friends, with diverse backgrounds, in order to make it through. We struggle together and help one another through the hard times, but also celebrate and have fun together.

Additionally, the professors at MIT, for the most part, truly care about their students and go out of the way to get to know them and assist them. Once you get into your major classes, the class sizes are small and become close-knit, not only with the other students, but also with the professors.

The students at MIT feel free to let themselves shine. Although they are swamped with work, they still find time to devote hours to dancing, to varsity sports, to building roller coasters in front of their dorms, to helping their community, and to hacking. The students are incredibly well-rounded and, surprisingly, not very competitive. They tend to strive to be their personal bests instead of competing with others.",,,
Dartmouth,GMAT Club,"Tuck has the best alumni. I have NEVER had an alumn forget to call me back. The school takes pride in being selective and small. For this reason alumni from Partners at MBB to bankers are willing to take time for a quick chat.

The claases are very diverse and are cooperative. Grade non-disclosure encourages students to cooperate instead of compete for career prospects. For this reason, Tuck is the ""nice"" school.

I think the career services center does a great job of bringing companies to campus, the problem is they are sometimes a bit busy to help you case and prepare for your interviews.

Consulting powerhouse. 10% of the class of 2022 went to work for Bain. Very impressive.",,,

It allows for more interpersonal communication between classmates and professors and fosters a more personal and curated business school experience. This powerful dynamic extends beyond the classroom, everyone from your administrators to your career counselors know your name and your interests inside and outside the classroom. The ability to travel abroad in small groups of first and second years during our Global Insights Expedition is another unique feature of the Tuck program, and a favorite part of my time at Tuck so far. I highly recommend this program.",,,
Dartmouth,GMAT Club,"Tuck has an incredibly supportive and high caliber student body. The professors are world class and the facilities provided by the school are second to none.

Hanover and the upper valley Is a great place to relocate to for two years, and the whole town has an amazing student town vibe to it. Overall, I think Tuck is a wonderful school but it's not for everyone. Tuck is a school for those who want to build life long friendships and networks, and are willing to happily relocate to a small town in New Hampshire for two years. It definitely isn't for those people who want to go to a school in a big city and who enjoy fancy restaurants and nightlife.",,,

Dartmouth,GMAT Club,"Tuck has taught me many things, but most importantly the sense of community and possibility. By community, I mean understanding that no matter where you are it is important to stick together and never betray your values. I intend to bring this to wherever I go and contribute in any way I can. By possibility, I mean Tuck gave me the security to trust myself and be certain that if I work hard and truly believe in what I do, I will be able to achieve something bigger than myself.

One of the most memorable moments of my MBA was when Federico Minoli, former CEO of Ducati, visited our Competitive & Corporate Strategy course. His vision and practical tips on turn-arounds and management completely redefined the way I see the competitive game within business.

Dartmouth,GMAT Club,"I spent two amazing years at Tuck and have found both the in-school experience and alumni body exactly as described when I first considered the school.

First, Tuck is a special place both for its beautiful location in Hanover, NH and for its world-renowned professors who commit to teaching and research. Granted, the location is not for everyone, but when it comes to recruiting it makes little difference. From the first week, we were consistently bombarded with recruiters from all the top consulting, finance, and tech firms in the country. The strength and reputation of any business school can be judged on this measure.

Second, the student body is limited to about 280 in each class. It makes for a more intimate learning environment, and frankly everyone gets to know each other over the course of two years. And how this translates to the classroom, and by extension the working world, is how well Tuck students work in teams and excel in collaboration.

Coming out of Tuck, I left with a toolkit of skills and experiences I could not have gotten had I not gone to business school.",,,
Dartmouth,GMAT Club,"Before I decided to apply for an MBA, I was a big-four Consultant based in New York City, where I had lived since graduating undergrad in 2010. I decided that consulting was not for me, and was looking for a set trajectory into investment banking. I knew I would be based in NYC after my MBA, so I was keen on finding a unique, immersive experience - far enough from the NYC that I felt like it was a real change, but close enough for IB recruiting to still be feasible. Tuck was the ideal choice for me - Hanover is a bucolic little college town with a tight-knit and vibrant community. I got to know each of my 281 classmates personally, and made many lifelong friendships. Choose Tuck if you want to be thrown into a routine where you depend and work closely with your classmates, if you are into new and unique experiences (hockey?, snowboarding?), if you hope to have your partner to feel welcome as a part of your day to day MBA experience, and if you are keen on engaging in dialogue with some of the best professors in the world. Within three months of starting at Tuck, I had signed an offer with the investment bank of my choice (career services tailors the recruiting process very closely to your own capabilities), and was able to plan the remainder of my time at Tuck to take classes I wouldn't have otherwise, and to travel internationally (10+ countries!). I would advise future applicants to visit the campus beforehand, sit in on classes, and engage with current and former students to learn just how immersive/rewarding their two years can be.",,,
Dartmouth,GMAT Club,"I came to Tuck knowing that I wanted a small and intimate b-school experience, and that is exactly what I have gotten so far. You get to know your classmates both in and out of the classroom, and you can shape your experience to whatever fits your goals and needs. You definitely have to ""want"" to come here, being out the middle of nowhere with 280 of your closest friends (560 if you count both classes) so be sure you articulate why Tuck is important to you, since it definitely isn't for everyone. Tuck is also great at connecting prospective students with current ones, and they will do their best job to ensure that your campus visit and interview leave you with the impression that Tuck is all about community and getting to know you. Best advice for applicants: know what it is about Tuck that speaks to you and how you can add value to the class.",,,
Dartmouth,GMAT Club,"Tuck knows it's strengths and plays to them extremely well. The career prospects for consulting are unmatched and the alumni network is extremely responsive and helpful when seeking employment. My classmates were impressive and friendly -- many I will stay in touch with for the rest of my life.

Social life is made up of house parties, bars in town, and tons of events on campus. You'll get fatigue of activities before you ever get bored. Hanover is quaint and hospitable and a handful of new eateries (with surprisingly fantastic food) have popped up in the last two years. There is easy access to New York via a luxury bus-line (over-sized leather chairs, wi-fi, keurig, snacks, and drinks) and Boston is 2 hours away. Most students bring cars.

There is no doubt that I am better set up to succeed in my career after attending the Tuck School of Business. I went back last month with my consulting firm to recruit more students because the firm I work for sees great succes hiring at Tuck. Don't let the location scare you off, the upside is tremendous.",,,
Dartmouth,GMAT Club,"The entire student body is incredibly nice. It's hard to find a mean person at Tuck. However, the school does not attract as many diverse students as some of the other schools located in big cities. This is a bit of a disappointment. I will give Tuck credit though, as they are making significant efforts to fix this. The number of women enrolled at Tuck is up from 32% to 42%, which is a huge leap in just one year. I would like to see more diversity in terms of ethnic backgrounds and socioeconomic standing.

Herd mentality is a bit strong at Tuck. Almost everyone does hiking, hockey, skiing, and other winter sports because their friends are doing it.

The alumni of Tuck are amazing. They have been incredibly helpful to me during my job search. It's true that they are willing to drop everything to spend time talking to you. Of all the alumni that I have reached out to, everyone has gotten back to me promptly. The size of the alumni base is not that big, but they are MIGHTY.

Location - this is probably the hardest thing for me to adjust to and it will vary from person to person. I thought living in a small rural town would be fun, but I miss city life so much. If you're an outdoorsy person, you should have no problem. If you are used to public transportation, convenience, a thousand different activities and restaurants to sample, then Hanover may be a difficult transition.",,,
Dartmouth,GMAT Club,"Tuck has met all my expectations to date. First, it provides a wide range of opportunities not only limited to consulting or banking. There are a myriad of general management jobs and more recently technology jobs available. While there are lot of opportunities for the Northeast, increasingly there are opportunities further afield with a growing alumni base out on the West Coast. Overall, I found the Careers Development Office and the alumni network to be valuable resources in the job search.

Tuck is a close-knit program that really focuses on community. Since Dean Slaughter took over, there has been an increased focus on innovation and global experiences. I am very optimistic about the changes that Dean Slaughter will push forward and believe that Tuck will continue to improve its offer while keeping the thing that it is really good at - the close-knit residential full-time MBA program.

Due to the small class size, you really can get to know all your classmates. To date, I know every single person of my class and around 50-60% of the class above and below. There is something to be said for shared experiences and I think this is the primary reason why Tuck has such strong alumni support. Whenever I speak with an alum, we frequently talk about things happening at Tuck and age old traditions like tripod hockey or skiing at Killington.

Tuck is not for everyone due to its size and location but I personally viewed both as big advantages. I would recommend any applicant to take advantage of the open interview system to visit and interview on campus. You may be surprised!

The core curriculum is a key component of Tuck and I really like how it stitches together to form a cohesive experience. In particular, Professors Neslin and Kopalle, who both teach core statistics, are phenomenal professors.

Tuck also has some great healthcare classes due to its close ties with Geisel, the medical school at Dartmouth.",,,
Dartmouth,Niche,Dartmouth is a great place to study for sure. The professors are kind and always willing to help. Classmates are friendly. The weather might bother but one good thing about it is that the school has its own skiway which is 20 mins drive from the campus.,,,
Dartmouth,Niche,"Dartmouth appeals to a specific type of person. As an Ivy League school, the College offers a lot of institutional funding for student's education, faculty, and experiences both on and off campus. The quaint New England setting is in one of the most picturesque parts of the country and it offers a kind of quiet that allows you to focus on your studies. If you're looking for a party school in a big city, this isn't it.",,,
Dartmouth,Niche,"Dartmouth has been incredible. It’s a really small school, and that makes the experience so unique - you really get to know your class, and you see your friends everywhere you go on campus. The dedication that the professors have to their students is incredible. They are all there mainly to teach undergraduate students, and you can tell. The profs take their time to learn about you and your individual interests, and the small classes help facilitate this dynamic. While Hanover can feel isolated sometimes, my overall experience at Dartmouth has been better than I could have ever hoped for.",,,
Dartmouth,Niche,"My overall experience at Dartmouth College has been incredibly enriching. The close-knit community here is something I deeply appreciate. It’s a place where you feel supported, not just by your peers but also by faculty and staff who are genuinely invested in your success. The 10-week term system is fast-paced but keeps you constantly engaged and learning.

What I love most about Dartmouth is the access to nature—it’s a place where I can hike, ski, and take advantage of the beautiful outdoors while also diving deep into my studies. The community is diverse and offers the chance to meet people from so many different backgrounds, enriching the overall college experience. From being involved in extracurriculars like the Nathan Smith Society and the Women in Science Project to living with my sorority sisters, there’s never a dull moment. It’s a place where you’re constantly challenged, but in the best way possible.",,,
Dartmouth,Niche,"The school is in the middle of nowhere. SO, the school community is very close, and the people are very approachable. It is a very walkable town/campus, and so it is easy to get to classes. The town of Hanover has a lot of restaurants, but also a lot of old people. SO, most of the activities are really just on campus. Since Dartmouth owns a lot of land in the area, the outdoor scene is fantastic. If you are into hiking, climbing, kayaking, and anything else outdoors-adjacent, it is the perfect spot.",,,
Dartmouth,Niche,"I really liked the fact that it's a smaller school( smallest of the Ivies) its a couple hours from Boston, 4-5 from NYC and the Dartmouth Outing Club is the best!",,,
Harvard,GMAT Club,"My experience during the Harvard MBA program was transformative, both professionally and personally. I entered the program seeking to sharpen my leadership skills, broaden my global perspective, and build a network of peers who shared the drive to make meaningful impact. Harvard exceeded those expectations.

The case method was a standout feature—it pushed me to think critically, speak with confidence, and make decisions under uncertainty. Every class felt like a real-world boardroom, filled with diverse perspectives and rich debate. The faculty were not just subject-matter experts, but also deeply committed to student development.

Outside the classroom, the ecosystem at Harvard was unparalleled. I took part in cross-disciplinary initiatives like the i-Lab, worked on global immersions that took me to developing economies, and collaborated with classmates who were former military officers, entrepreneurs, and social impact leaders. Each interaction expanded my understanding of what leadership means in a complex world.",,,
Harvard,GMAT Club,"I gained so much perspective from listening to the perspectives of my classmates. We thought about solving tough problems in different ways - and that really comes our during the case method. The professors really brought out these perspectives through carefully facilitated conversations. The end result was that I improved my business judgement and communication skills. I can look at large amounts of information, quickly figure out what matters, analyze that information, and make a recommendation.",,,
Harvard,GMAT Club,"Classmates are very bright, curious and come from a broad array of interesting backgrounds both professionally and personally. While the total class size is very large (900+ students). Being divided into sections of 90 students with whom you spend every classroom hour your first year and countless social hours creates a fun close-knit group.

Case method is very engaging and facilitates a ton of learning even though it is frequently at a high level (not as tactical or technical). Participation (and attendance) is a huge part of your grade so everyone, for the most part, shows up prepared and engaged. Academics as a result are a bit more time-consuming than I anticipated but the classes have been great. Have 2-3 cases a day 5 days a week (some days off for holidays and ""career search"" are sprinkled throughout the semester).",,,
Harvard,GMAT Club,"Academics -- Incredible opportunity to take classes with renowned experts in their fields. I really enjoyed the Case Method, because it was more interactive and engaging than other classes that I've taken, but also provided opportunities to practice ""speaking up"", which is a very relevant skill in the professional world.

Culture -- Culture felt more cerebral and scholarly than other business schools I've seen. The student body was pretty tight knit and collaborative. However, there was a huge emphasis placed on wealth, and friend groups tended to form across ""class"" lines.

Networking -- Hands down the greatest value add of HBS. Alumni have a very strong presence on and off campus, and HBS grads tend to stick together. Most people found jobs through the alumni network (including myself)

Value -- Great value for the money -- probably the best. Very generous financial aid package (need-based) and the brand/network benefits pay dividends long after graduation.

Very good well-rounded traditional curriculum, but it felt outdated in many ways. With so many people going into Tech after graduation, I was disappointed by the lack of classes/field opportunities devoted strictly to digital innovation. Not a lot of sales classes either.",,,
Harvard,GMAT Club,"HBS has provided everything I could possibly want in a business school. The faculty is incredible (I've had classes with the former PepsiCo CEO, Danaher CEO, and COO of the Patriots) and the section experience during RC year really brings the size of the campus down. I've developed extraordinary friendships with fellow students from myriad backgrounds and know many of these will be lifelong friendships. The only complaint that I have about the program is that we don't have any weekly day off like many other programs do (Kellogg has Tuesdays off, Anderson gets Friday off). Honestly though, the fact that is my biggest complaint about the program shows how great the program is.

Coming from consulting, I heard a lot of opinions about various business schools. While much of the information I got from my co-workers was accurate, you can't truly understand HBS until you visit a class. The case method is a completely different learning experience and it's intellectually stimulating in a way lecture-based classes aren't. Choosing HBS was the best decision I've ever made and couldn't be happier here.",,,
Harvard,GMAT Club,"HBS provides an incredible platform academically, socially, and professionally. The instructors are world class, both professors and practitioners. The guests are world renowned, and many. The students are incredible, having achieved an enormous amount, and hailing from all around the world . The biggest criticism that I have heard of HBS is the size of the classroom - this works only to enhance the number and quality of your friends and classmates, and I would not have it any other way. You will keep meeting new people and making new friends deep into your experience. Additionally, when engaging with firms, there is likely to be a classmate who has worked at or alongside those firms.",,,
Harvard,GMAT Club,"I wasn't sure what to expect from business school, but HBS has blown my expectations out of the water. The support and kindness of fellow students is wonderful, the willingness of the professors and students to help with career or personal endeavors is fantastic, and the friends I have made are life-long.

The brand is as powerful as one might expect, but it doesn't open every door automatically. It gets you in front of most people, but you still need to prove yourself. The bar is set high when people are talking to and working with an HBS grad.

I'd suggest future applicants to question the negative stereotypes. While they exist at all schools, they are such a minority of the experience.",,,
Harvard,GMAT Club,"HBS is a great place to go to business school. Some key areas that distinguish it from other programs:

- Brand Name: when you say you go to HBS, people take note, even if they aren't in the business world. Sounds a bit stuck up to say, but frankly, if you're going to spend $200k on an MBA, that's the reaction you need.

- Case Method: nearly all classes here are case method where you read a case and debate what decisions should be made in class. And you often have the case protagonist in the room because HBS professors write most of the cases. By the time you graduate, you've made thousands of real world decisions and had to defend them to very smart people.

- Sections: HBS is a huge b-school with nearly 1000 students, but in your first year, you're put in a section of ~95 students. This group becomes your family and really helps make a big school feel small. You get the huge alumni network with the small school intimacy. Win win",,,
Harvard,GMAT Club,"My time at HBS met or exceeded my expectations in every regard. The school offered everything an MBA program could provide: broad range of courses, distinguished faculty, incredible diversity of student background, immersive social environment, countless opportunities for international study and travel, fantastic career development resources, and an impressive and global alumni network. I met so many new friends and learned so much that I feel my life has been enriched from this experience - which is remarkable for a degree in business. Overall, the program was an amazing two years, and I would choose HBS again in a heartbeat.",,,
Harvard,GMAT Club,"I think the school guanrantees you one of the following : your dream job ; a great network; or unparalleled partying. Where people go wrong is trying to attain all three. Pick one and you will get it!

Classmates were very nice and smart. Never really encountered the Harvard stereotype.

The classes were interesting but don’t expect to get specialized knowledge such as accounting , modeling, or deep supply chain knowledge. Harvard Business School focuses more on teaching you how to think and problem solve, which coincidentally the skill I use the most at work now.

Even at a top tech company, many of my coworkers struggle to understand problems from a director’s level but reading 10,000 case studies allows you to hone the practice.

Limited flexibility in choosing classes, no ability to specialize and you won’t get SME experience",,,
Harvard,GMAT Club,"I had two expectations going into HBS. The first was to expand my network and the second was to come out of the program working on my own business venture. HBS met and exceeded both of these expectations. The network I was able to build with fellow students and alumni is invaluable. There have been countless times I have already reached out to old classmates or alumni to get their advice on something I have been working on. Launching my own startup was also a primary reason for going to business school. HBS is very supportive of entrepreneurship and has tons of resources at both HBS and throughout the wider Harvard community that have come in handy as I launch my own venture.
",,,
Harvard,GMAT Club,"HBS has the most unique classroom experience with the case study method and engagement model. Everyone who is serious about attending HBS should first attend a a class on campus to “get it”. For applications then, the lens to look at your application through is if you’ll add something unique to the classroom. At HBS, each student’s experience is highly dependent on their classmates. Therefore, if you do not add anything unique and insightful to the classroom, you are dead space and reducing everyone else’s ecperience. Therefore, highlight your uniqueness and ability to add nuance and insight to the classroom and that’s your ticket into HBS",,,
Harvard,GMAT Club,"Business school is unfortunately not a 2 year vacation at HBS. Classes are challenging - you always have to be on top of your game because of class participation and cold calls - and the learning curve in the first semester is very steep. Class attendance is mandatory (HBS has a very strict attendance policy) and there is class 5 days a week. What that does is force everyone to be very engaged, leading to better discussions, and a lot more learning than if it were just the professor speaking. That being said, the case method is a little more difficult to enact in classes like finance and accounting, and it can be hard for those with non-finance backgrounds to get up to speed quickly because the school just throws you in the deep end with financial modeling.

HBS completely met my needs because I wanted to come to business school to learn something (and not be paying $75k/year just to network). It was academically a lot harder than I expected, but everyone is very nice and helpful - a lot of pre-HBS finance people do section reviews out of their desire to help their sectionmates. However this also means that if you’re expecting to come to HBS to cruise or even work on a start up idea, the rigorous curriculum means you might not have the time to do that.",,,
Harvard,GMAT Club,"Came to HBS the military hoping to transition to investment banking. I found the case method to be extremely frustrating at first, but over time I adjusted and have come to really enjoy class and feel like I have learned a lot. The required curriculum taken during the first year gave me a good business foundation that I feel prepared me well for my summer internship and the elective curriculum taken during the second year.

I suggest that future applicants understand what the case method means. If you want to come to business school to party and relax, realize that everyone must do SOME prep for every class. For some people that means 1-2 hours (me) and for others 30min - 1hour. If you blow off prep I think the 80 minutes of class would be quite boring.",,,
Harvard,GMAT Club,"One can feel incredibly lucky to be accepted to Harvard Business School. The school is reference in terms of state-of-the-art management practices, constantly doing relevant research and staying in contact with leading industry executives, often HBS grads themselves. The Case method is incredibly helpful in facilitating the transition from Junior level positions to Management as it helps students think about the problem as a whole and not focus on specific aspects of the theory being thaught. The faculty is incredible and constantly amazed me with their level of preparation and how well they know both the subject and the students.",,,
Harvard,GMAT Club,"HBS has largely exceeded my expectations, in particular the wonderful faculty and students. The case method, while an adjustment at the beginning, has proven to be a most insightful teaching tool. I'm continuously surprised by the intelligence and diversity of the student population. Moreover, I truly believe that HBS has some of the best student organizations amongst top businesses schools. However, the career department needs to step up its game as there are few true value-added services provided by the school, and most students (even those who are pursuing traditional career paths) have to rely on their fellow classmates and student clubs for career help.",,,
Harvard,GMAT Club,"Loving my experience so far. The section experience is probably the highlight. My classmates are incredibly accomplished yet down to earth. I don't see anyone being competitive. Academic experience is more intense than what my friends at other schools are reporting, but I view that as a real differentiator and a big reason why I chose HBS. Case method classes can be nerve-racking yet invigorating. The first year is very structured. You are told what classes to take and where to sit. You have the same seat in the same classroom with the same 94 people for every class. The professors rotate in and out. It helps you get to know your sectionmmates better.

Don't only rely on the on campus options. If you know what you want to do before school starts, start reaching out to Alumni early. The internship I wanted didn't recruit at HBS but the alumni working at the company got me in front of there right people and I was able to secure an internship. The HBS degree might sometimes be a target on your back, people assume things about you, so when doing off campus recruiting it's really important to convey your interest and show how serious you are about that particular role.",,,
Harvard,GMAT Club,"Overall I got a lot out of attending HBS. The first year was really regimented which was a bit frustrating for me but second year was a lot of fun as I dove into subjects that I was passionate about. The faculty are world class and readily accessible to students, alumni answer your emails, and despite the reputation, most everyone is friendly and willing to help you out. I am friends with many HBSers to this very day and I still remember them taking the time to work with me on financial models or accounting principles outside of class when they could otherwise have been doing more fun things.

The biggest surprise for me was the sheer amount of work involved. Between case prep, study groups, and classes, HBS seems to have the heaviest academic workload of the top b-school programs despite the fact that it has a reputation of being filled with people only focused on networking (probably true for some but not most).

I went into HBS to either do a startup or try to transition into tech. I started a tech startup during school and leveraged their many resources available to entrepreneurs. The relationships we developed with the school, faculty, and the broader Boston startup scene really helped a great deal. I've since transitioned to a large tech company in product marketing and I still leverage many of the things I learned at b-school every day.",,,
Harvard,GMAT Club,"I came to HBS to make a pivot in my career. Though I did make a pivot, it definitely wasn't the one I expected.

The plan was to go from being an engineer and product manager at a big tech company, to being a product marketer at a big tech company. I had a clear sense of who I was, what I wanted to do, and why I wanted to do it. I believe this is a large part of why I got accepted into HBS (and only HBS). Ultimately, I ended up founding my own tech startup instead. I never expected that to happen.

The HBS program challenged me in ways I didn't expect. It wasn't academically challenging, but personally challenging. I was pushed to try everything, to explore, and to learn more about myself in the process. It was that exploration that led to my ultimate career choice.

The student body still leans towards management, finance, and consulting, but academically you can't really specialize like you can at other schools. HBS teaches you just enough about every topic to be a competent manager, and nothing more. This is not the right experience for everyone.

Future applicants: have a story ready that described who you are, what you've done, and what you want to do. Incorporate different elements of that overarching narrative into components of your application.

Things at HBS might feel hokey or ""kumbaya"" at times. Don't become cynical. Embrace all the weird and oddball activities. Get everything you can out of every experience, even ones that you think are completely outside of your interests.

If you start a company right after school you can get $10,000 of your student debt forgiven by the HBS Rock Center. This is a great deal.",,,
Harvard,Niche,"Harvard Business School was genuinely transformative. The case method is intense and incredibly effective—it pushed me to think critically, speak up, and consider a wide range of perspectives every single day. The classroom dynamic was electric. My peers were brilliant, driven, and came from all over the world, which made for rich discussions and long-lasting friendships. The access to world-class faculty, networking opportunities, and resources (like the i-lab and career services) is unmatched. The leadership development component is also incredibly strong—you don’t just learn to manage businesses, you learn to lead people.

Worst Parts:
It can be overwhelming. The environment is very high-pressure and performance-driven, which sometimes felt intense or isolating. If you’re not used to that pace or culture, it can take time to adjust. Also, while HBS is working on diversity and inclusion, there’s still work to be done in making all students feel equally seen and supported.",,,
Harvard,Niche,"Attending Harvard Business School has been a life-changing opportunity—one that I don’t take for granted. I’ve grown tremendously, both personally and professionally, and I’m committed to using this experience to make a meaningful impact in my community and beyond.

That said, the financial burden is significant. Despite making careful financial plans and pursuing available aid, I am still in need of additional financial assistance to continue my studies without the added stress of financial hardship. Receiving further support would allow me to stay fully engaged in the academic and leadership opportunities here and continue preparing for a career dedicated to service and equity.",,,
Harvard,Niche,"My business school experience has been incredible. My classmates are down-to-earth, curious, fun, and genuinely supportive, making every interaction enjoyable and enriching. Classes are engaging, challenging, and thought-provoking, pushing me to grow while still being a great time. Beyond the classroom, the alumni network is phenomenal—welcoming, inspiring, and always willing to connect and help. Their kindness and thoughtfulness make it clear that this community extends far beyond just two years on campus. The combination of engaging academics, incredible peers, and a truly special alumni network has made this experience not only transformative but also deeply rewarding.",,,
Harvard,Niche,"The HBS community fosters an environment where students are motivated to pursue their entrepreneurial interests. The extensive resources available cater to the distinct requirements of innovators, both in and out of the classroom. The diverse global perspectives within the immersive learning setting contribute to a continuous exchange of dynamic ideas, resulting in significant and enduring impact. With a rich history of entrepreneurship, marked by over 50% of graduates initiating at least one new venture, HBS remains committed to supporting alumni through comprehensive programs that encourage collaboration and lifelong learning.",,,
Harvard,Niche,"Harvard's case method will allow me to learn how to structure strategic decisions, as well as practice presenting and problematizing decisions in real-time with a diverse set of peers. While enhancing my leadership skills, I will delve into key topics such as measuring impact, managing human capital, and implementing social capital practices. Courses like “Transforming Education through Social Entrepreneurship” will help me apply these learnings in educational and non-profit settings.

I plan to gain hands-on experience through Harvard's immersive extracurriculars. Harvard's Management Consulting Club offers mock interviews and interactive case workshops, which will deepen my content expertise and credibility in the consulting space. Additionally, engaging with a local organization as a visiting Board Fellow will provide me insight into social impact enterprises, such as the Linda M. Walczak Children's Literacy Fund.",,,
NYU,GMAT Club,"Now that I’m one year out and at the rosy shades of a 70% virtual experience (sarcasm) have waned, I figured it was time to write up a review.

I recruited for a number of industries, and found the school’s network, but perhaps more predominantly the location, to be invaluable. There are subsets of opportunities only found at NY schools by nature of being in the city. Recruiting for the common career paths is well structured and is ran in tandem with student clubs. I am currently on the buyside and found that the overall brand compares very favorably to peer schools (SOM, Tuck, etc.).

The faculty and teaching quality is second to none and probably the hidden gem of the program. There are the most Nobel laureates on faculty of any MBA program and the classes were phenomenal. You can cross list 15+ credits with other schools which was something I readily took advantage of. Of course, the overall value add that you get out of this may be minimal in the grand scheme of things, since MBAs are all about those superficial two-minute conversations. In all seriousness, I was able to make a few close friends, but definitely did miss out a bit because of a global pandemic.

So, in the end, great MBA.

NYU,GMAT Club,"NYU Stern really focuses on recruiting for IQ and EQ (emotional intelligence), and it shows in the student body. I have had the opportunity to meet so many wonderful and smart people, and the network you make from this program is very worthwhile. The course and professors are interesting to - in the night classes you will often find professors who are experts in their field and currently working. The founder of Buzzfeed occasionally teaches a night class. The recrutiting options for off-campus jobs are great as well because of the location in NYC. Any company you could possibly want to network with is just a subway ride away. I have seen other students from schools in Boston at recruiting events, and they travel down to NYC Thursday night and have to get a hotel for the weekend to do the same thing that I can do leaving my apartment in the morning.

The recruiting process is solid and great companies do come to campus, but it can be a little difficult to get top jobs if you don't have a great background coming into the program. There are plenty of kids with awesome GMAT scores and great grades who didn't even get an interview for MBB. That's not to stay it's not possible to get top consulting jobs, but they don't take many people from Stern (at least for internships). IB is a different story - plenty of people get internships at top banks. Some people who recruit for banking get no banking offers, but the majority get something, and every bank you could possibly want to work for recruits in decent numbers at Stern. It's also a good place to go if you want to work at Amazon - we send a bunch of people there every year.
",,,
NYU,GMAT Club,"NYU Stern excels in attracting a diverse and talented student body and the location (B-School in SoHo) probably cannot be beat by any other institution. Formally an investment banking feeder, the school has been expanding its reach into the Strategy/Management Consulting, Tech and Luxury Retail fields post financial downturn with incremental success. Every year, things get a little bit better on this front. More student go for these jobs, more get hired, and so on. That being said, if you're interested in Investment Banking or other sell-side jobs, it's a great place to go to business school.

While the student body is in my opinion its biggest asset, the school is still figuring out how to balance bringing in more diversity with the more mundane institutional goals of running a business school (making sure student GMAT scores and post-graduation salaries remain competitive enough to generate a high USNews Ranking). What I mean by this is, someone joining the school who was formerly a photographer, that then goes and works for an economic development non-profit after graduation, probably won't help those raw numbers (lower GMAT, lower salary), but will add tremendous value to the NYU community and should be admitted to the school. Balancing those still requires some work and is the only area where I think NYU needs to see improvement.",,,
NYU,GMAT Club,"NYU offers a great experience for those interested in moving into finance or looking to come to New York. I was interested in advancing my own skills in finance and strategy, and NYU had a variety of courses that met my needs. The professors really make the classes interesting, and NYU has a wide range of great professors (even outside of finance/IB). The student body is very diverse, and there are lots of opportunities to network with professionals in the city. The university is also in the process of expanding and improving course offerings in Luxury, Entrepreneurship, and Fin Tech. Be sure to visit if you are interested in joining!",,,
NYU,GMAT Club,"There are lots of opportunities but the full time program gets the majority of the resources and prestige. They also have good networking opportunities and a better selection for some classes.

There are happy hours that are setup weekly with your core group and many students are happy to network. However the grind from going to work and then class can be quite difficult at times.

You need to be proactive to make connections and friends. Many of the professors are understanding of the workload and are there to help you along the way. Furthermore, they have many connections in the industry and there are a few that are noble prize winners which is great!",,,
NYU,GMAT Club,"Location-wise it's the best among all business schools. At the same time, being in NYC means you have to network and hustle a lot more on your own. But if you put in the effort, you can open up a lot of various opportunities such as doing a semester internship in a start-up or PE shop or a tech company.

Recruiting for finance is pretty strong and the school is building up momentum in other industries such as consulting and tech.

Student body and alumni network are VERY supportive and collaborative, which are exactly what I wanted out of a business school.",,,
NYU,GMAT Club,"The community itself is extremely diverse with a substantial portion of the students coming from international locations. The clubs are all student run and we get a lot of opportunity to interact with the other students as well as admin and faculty.
There’s a strong sense of paying it forward and MBA2’s go out of their way to help MBA1’s with recruiting and everything else. There’s almost always a wait list for volunteering opportunities to help incoming students, new admits and MBA1’s. I personally benefited immensely thanks to the MBA2’s being involved heavily in college activities.

One of the biggest advantages is being in the heart of NYC which gives students unparalleled access to all major firms, prominent guest lecturers that Stern brings in weekly, a plethora of projects and mentors.

The faculty is outstanding with particularly strong marketing and finance departments. Strategy professors all work on the cutting edge in real world projects and therefore bring the latest learning’s from the field to the class.
Experiential learning programs like the Stern Consulting Corps give students a chance to apply classroom theory to real world scenarios while being mentored by a Stern professor. Because all the clients are local (companies in NYC) you get more face time and therefore more chance to interact with your clients.
The Stern Signature Projects are unique in that you will be solving really unstructured problems for some high impact clients (usually with a social focus).
While the experience on both of these depends on the kind of team you have, as long as you are easy to work with and flexible you will have a really good experience on both of these.

Stern has traditionally been strong in finance but now does really well in consulting and marketing recruiting as well.
Recruiting will be a big part of your life when you start at business school. While Stern’s location helps it immensely, I feel that the banking recruiting is more structured than the consulting recruiting. MBB don’t consider Stern a core school and take a total of about 20 people combined. Higher ranked schools definitely send more students to these firms.
That being said, the Stern community (students and the career development team) are great resources to prepare for jobs. Programming starts almost immediately and by the time interview season starts you are more or less prepared for all interviews. Recruiting is definitely hard work and from my experience the people who work the hardest are definitely rewarded with great offers. Everyone ends up with an offer for the summer, but it may not be their top choice of firm.

The exposure you will get in terms of companies is unparalleled. I was able to attend numerous events hosted by companies in the city and work my way through the networking to land interviews with most of the top consulting firms.
This becomes all the more important with investment banking which is more networking heavy.",,,
NYU,GMAT Club,"NYU really does take advantage of its location in downtown New York City. The clubs do an amazing job organizing corporate visits. Job interviews are often just a walk or subway ride from campus and plenty of companies come to campus for information sessions and recruiting.

There is a good breadth and depth of courses offered, although some are only offered in the evenings. Students have been petitioning for more day sections.

There are multiple ""superstar"" professors and they are generally worth seeking out if they teach in your area of interest. I would say that the quality of teacher (and to a lesser extent, classmates) had more influence on the value of the course than the material and its applicability to my career.

DBI study abroad experiences are worth it for the educational, but mostly cultural and social aspects.

NYU,GMAT Club,"Finance professors are very strong. I know many people who have come in to change their lives and have done so.

I would encourage incoming students to begin researching professors and their career paths.

As a Stern MBA you can take classes in other premier schools such as Courant.

I am emphasizing math/finance due to my background and goals.

Almost all professors will take meetings regarding entrepreneurial ideas, and will offer valuable input.",,,
NYU,GMAT Club,"I went to Stern to transition from Consulting into Investment Management. Not only I was able to achieve my primary goal which was to get my ideal job after the business school, I had a great time and built life-long friendships. I took classes from Nobel laureates and traveled to other countries to learn more about their cultures and businesses. I was able to take advantage of the Stern's premier location and the strong alumni network to achieve my post-MBA career goals. In addition, almost every student at the school get involved in several students clubs to improve their leadership skills and help the next class to have a good MBA experience.",,,
NYU,GMAT Club,"Excellent MBA program. Has surpassed all my expectations. Has excellent professors, which I really value since I am a career changer and actually need to learn something during my MBA. Career services is also a huge plus; there are tons of resources to help you find an internship.

The community of students has blown me away. There is a very diverse student body and we quickly bonded to become great friends. There are close to 400 students per year, so even though you probably won't be friends with all of them, there is a great pool of people to meet. Everyone is extremely intelligent and interesting.
",,,
NYU,GMAT Club,"I knew Stern was a very well rounded school and I had high expectations going in. But two things that still surprised me were (1) The amount of firms that recruit at the school is astounding. Practically every investment bank, consulting firm, brand house etc comes to the school and not just once but multiple times throughout the year. You really benefit from the New York Location. (2) The people here are scarily intelligent. Both IQ wise and EQ wise. I have learned so much from my peers and have benefitted from their experiences. You can find many high IQ people at other schools but I'd be shocked if other schools also nailed the EQ part so well. Stern attracts true leaders who know the importance of location.",,,
NYU,GMAT Club,"I believe one of the most important things in Business School is recruiting - whether you'd like to admit it or not, most students come to business school to find a better job when they graduate.

I was an unorthodox student at Stern. I wasn't interested in Banking and thought I would give consulting a shot (yes - Stern is pretty good for the future consulting). However, I realized quickly that I'm not interested in consulting either. After a trip to the Silicon Valley, I figured that that's the place for me.

However, being in New York, it wasn't easy to make this transition. Unfortunately, I believe that my recruiting process was successful because of me, and despite our career services. I'm afraid that most associates at that office are not familiar enough with what we call off-campus recruiting, and that was biggest challenge during my time at Stern.

After learning things the hard way in my first year, I managed to land an awesome job at one of the big tech companies in the Bay Area.

In short, Stern is probably one of the best schools if you want to follow the typical pattern of I-Banking or consulting. However, if you want something atypical, go someplace else.",,,
NYU,GMAT Club,"I had my doubts about the quality of education and the student body before accepting. However, after spending 5 months (2 semesters -Fall and Winter Intensive), I feel NYU-Stern is by far one of the best part time programs out there.

Pros -
- Student body diversity. This helps in class since you get to learn from everyone's experience, sometimes more than the professor.
- Location, Location, Location!!
- Faculty
- Resources

Cons -
- Curriculum is quite intensive, but maybe this is a pro
- I can't think of anymore cons but maybe the full time ranking can be improved a little more.

I know one of my classmate got admitted to Yale executive program and after a campus visit decided NYU was better. Another got admitted to Chicago booth executive program and after spending a semester, decided NYU was better. I can't compare the quality of Langone program to any other top business schools since I haven't had any first hand experience, but so far my experience has been excellent.

This is an intensive program and you will be tired with the work load. Be mentally prepared to put in the hard work! Secondly, make use of the location. We have people all the way from Miami and Michigan attending weekend classes. However, if you have the option, try to move within Manhattan so you can make use of the network and social events. There's plenty going on at campus!

The faculty is top rated and most of them are not just research professors, but work closely with corporate organizations. The faculty are frequently quoted in social media and publish articles on a regular basis that helps improve the NYU brand.

The Career center has a full time team to help not only FT but also Part Time MBA students during recruiting. There is a special program that part time students can enroll to brush up on their interview skills and prepare for on-campus recruiting. The program runs for almost a year and is free of cost. Only students who are graduating in next 18 months and have completed their core curriculum can sign up. After completing students are allowed to participate in on-campus recruiting along with Full Time students.",,,

The diversity among my peers enhances our discussions, offering varied perspectives on business challenges. Stern's location in NYC is ideal for networking and accessing career opportunities, which is crucial for a working professional like me. The flexibility of evening and weekend classes allows me to balance my professional and academic commitments effectively. Stern equips students with advanced business knowledge and fosters personal and professional growth, making it an exceptional choice for anyone aspiring to excel in the business world.",,,
NYU,Niche,"I appreciate its structured approach and global outlook. The division into six modules, each comprising intensive full-time week courses, provides a focused learning experience, delving deeper into analytics methodologies and their practical implementations.

The interactive teaching style remains a standout feature, fostering engaging discussions and collaborative activities that enhance comprehension beyond conventional classroom learning.

The emphasis on coding proficiency remains crucial, and I find myself consistently developing my skills in R, SQL, and Excel. These languages are proving to be indispensable tools in tackling complex analytical problems, and I'm excited to see how these skills continue to evolve throughout the program.

Overall, I am finding this program to be an enriching journey, combining theoretical knowledge with practical applications and fostering a collaborative learning environment that continues to shape my analytical skill set.",,,
NYU,Niche,"Stern is incredibly challenging but so incredibly rewarding. The opportunities available to students here are numerous, whether it be extracurricular or academic. The professors deeply care about what they are teaching, but not in a way that prioritizes their work—the pedagogy matters just as much, if not more. I feel incredibly lucky to be a part of a program that also emphasizes the importance of emotional intelligence and business ethics in the business practice.",,,

Columbia,GMAT Club,"Columbia does not just teach business; it immerses you in it. The professors here are not just academics; they're real-world professionals who bring their firsthand experiences into the classroom. This approach made the lessons much more relatable and practical. They were always available for advice and genuinely cared about our success, which made a huge difference in my education.

What stands out most to me, though, is the community at Columbia. My classmates came from all over the world, each bringing unique perspectives that enriched our discussions and widened my understanding of global business. These relationships turned into a powerful network that has supported me professionally and personally beyond graduation.

The curriculum is challenging but incredibly rewarding, blending traditional business education with the latest trends and ethical considerations. It prepared me not just to enter the business world but to lead in it with integrity and vision.",,,
Columbia,GMAT Club,"I had a choice between HBS, Columbia and MIT. I chose Columbia for two reasons : one I wanted to be in Manhattan, the financial capital of the world and two HBS was going way over my budget. I had attended some programs at HBS earlier and I knew that while case method is very interactive and interesting but at the same time it leaves you yearning for some basic concepts and learning. Columbia was the right choice, it combined best of learning with humdrum of NYC. Location gives it solid advantage in terms of best of visitors who give you real insights in business and then you can really learn.
Another great thing at Columbia is the research that is being carried out. You will learn a lot!

Professors are solid and you will really love some the classes particularly on negotiations and operations.

All major banks and corporations are at the campus",,,
Columbia,GMAT Club,"I went to Columbia to get hired at an MBB consulting firm, and that's ultimately what happened, so I can certainly say the school met my expectations and goals. A few random thoughts about the school from a recent graduate:

One thing I didn't appreciate about CBS is since the school is located literally in Manhattan, it's much more difficult (and orders of magnitude more expensive) to construct new buildings, so this issue ultimately gets a pass from me.

Kellogg and Fuqua seem to have a lock on the community rep, but I think that CBS should be included in that conversation. Even with the myriad distractions in NYC (more on that below), CBS students have an incredibly strong connection to each other and the school. If I wanted to fill up every night of the week with club and social events purely with CBSers, it'd be very easy to do. The generally held viewpoint that CBS is internally extremely competitive and cutthroat is completely false.

This is something that I've always emphasized to prospective students: more than anything, CBS is about choice. Between academics, clubs, social events, networking, coffee chats, internships (in school and summer), mentoring, and the general distractions of NYC, there's always something to pull you in a different direction. Some of my classmates held essentially full-time jobs in Connecticut, others had three kids in Long Island, and others could always be counted on to be in Watson (the library) when not in class. Some were club kids who were constantly jet-setting, and others were at every single on campus event. The really nice aspect of this is that you could be part of one of these groups one week and another the next - the fluidity and frequency of events were strengths. After the core curriculum, academics is literally a choose-your-own-adventure, with no majors or departmental requirements to fulfill. A caveat here: if you're the type of person who needs more hand-holding and structure to your MBA experience, you may feel more lost at CBS. Those with a strong sense of self-direction and motivation tend to be more successful.

Of the big three placements (consulting, finance, tech), CBS excels in two of them and performs reasonably well in tech - all the big firms are on campus and seems like half my friends are going to Amazon. If you're not going into one of the bigger industries, your career search will have to be much more self-driven.

From a consulting perspective, CBS is amazing. I'm speaking from a biased perspective, as I was on the board of the Management Consulting Association and gave 100+ cases to first years, but the MCA is well-recognized as one of the best MBA consulting clubs for a reason. I was exposed to easily over a dozen top consulting firms with minimal effort on my own part, and formed solid relationships with recruiters and alumni at virtually all of them. Second year students actively help prep and recruit first years, and the recruiting atmosphere is collegiate and encouraging without being overly competitive.",,,
Columbia,GMAT Club,"I was happily impressed by the close-knit, collaborative, and supportive culture at Columbia Business School. The school's unparalleled location and opportunities across all industries makes it an obvious choice for those looking for and a fun and rewarding experience along with brand recognition and location. The alumni network is top-notch, and I never would have encountered the number of post-MBA opportunities I have without it. Columbia helped me achieve all of my post-MBA goals and I would not have been as happy or as satisfied at any other business school. Columbia Business School really is the best of all worlds!
",,,
Columbia,GMAT Club,"Columbia Business School is an excellent choice, especially for those pursuing finance jobs in New York. There is a huge alumni network and the school places well at all the top investment banks and other finance roles. When it comes to finding other opportunities, though, people can have a very different experience. For example, in my year it seemed as if most of the people recruiting for consulting did not land jobs in that industry. People recruiting for other, less standard, career paths also had a more difficult time than they might have expected.

Academic experiences can vary greatly by class. I had a couple that I thought were a little useful but most were a waste of time. Overall, I think CBS does a good job of teaching the basics of accounting and corporate finance but don't expect to get much more than that.

CBS is good if you want to go to B school in NY and stay in the city after. Two years after graduation, most of my friends are still in the city. This is helpful to keep professional and personal relationships.",,,

You will have the opportunity to engage with NYC-based industries to learn how they function. Columbia's Master Classes and Immersion Seminars will help you experience your desired industry in the NYC ecosystem. Only Columbia will offer you the opportunity to learn from the stalwarts of your industry. Columbia does offer a microcosm of diversity like no other program.",,,
Columbia,GMAT Club,"Columbia Business School has a great MBA program if you want to either (i) leverage your career in finance, especially portfolio management; or (ii) want to land a job in NYC, in several industries, ranging from consulting to investment banking to start-ups.
It may seem a little bit cliche, but the school does a tremendous job to create a network of professionals in NYC. Also, being in NYC makes it super easy for speakers to go to class. And since most of the professors are not just academic professors but also practitioners, the content of classes are very up to date of what is in the marketplace.
On the negative side, I can mention the lack of classes in other areas other than finance, especially leadership. In later years the dean is increasing the focus on this particular area, but my feeling is that it is behind other schools such as HBS, Wharton, etc.",,,
Columbia,GMAT Club,"Anyone that is considering Columbia is also likely considering a bunch of great schools that have many of the same positives; namely access to a great network, excellent professors, smart classmates, professional opportunities, and (everyone's favorite) Grade Non-Disclosure. From what I can tell there are 2 things that make Columbia stand out: New York City and finance classes/opportunities. I chose Columbia because it was a top 10 school (I didn't think anything less was really worth the investment) and I wanted to live in NY (mainly for personal reasons).

However, after going I can say that I think there are a few other things that make Columbia awesome:
- A surprising level of community, especially for a ""city school."" Orientation is definitely weighted towards the community side of things with a dash of academic and professional things scattered throughout, I think this is to make sure we have that community despite nobody really living on campus (not a lot of on campus housing, usually only goes to international students and a small set of west coasters). Throughout the year there are weekly happy hours on campus that are typically preceded by CBS Matters where 1-2 people from your cluster (~70 students you have all your core classes with) present about their life and what is important to them. CBS Matters is definitely my favorite thing about Columbia. In addition to on campus happy hour on Thursdays there is Rugby Happy Hour on Wednesdays at a bar a few subway stops away. It is open to the whole school, not just the rugby team (although I would highly recommend joining the rugby team because it's awesome), and usually has equal or better attendance than school-sponsored happy hour.
- A ton of travelling. This is something I haven't done as much as many of my classmates, mainly because it can get really expensive/often eats into time I could be spending with my husband. However, there are TONS of opportunities to travel. In the summer before school starts a huge chunk of the school takes part in the ""pre-MBA World Tour"" which includes student-organized trips pretty much all over the world (I got to take part in the final leg in the Hamptons with about 200 classmates). Then over fall break every cluster organizes a trip, we went to the Dominican Republic (one of my clustermates is from there so he planned most of it) and during winter and spring break the school offers “Global Immersion” classes and study tours to a ton of different places (Israel, Japan, South Korea, India, and Argentina are usually offered) to tour companies and sights. I took a Global Immersion class in Madrid about the European Financial Crisis which included full days of speakers who experienced the crisis first hand and evenings seeing the city, eating a lot of great food, going out to clubs, and touring the soccer stadium.
- NYC. I really only thought about this from a personal perspective coming in but it is a helpful resource since every industry and almost every big company has offices in NY you can find time to meet with people from any industry or company you might be interested in without having to plan your whole day or week around it. I took an immersion seminar last year where every Friday we visited a different consulting firm (BCG, Deloitte, PwC/Strategy&, and 10eqs) and there were a bunch of others offered too (big data, luxury goods, innovation). There are also conferences hosted on or near campus almost every week (I went to the media, marketing and women in business conferences). I just don't see those kind of things being possible outside of NY.

There definitely are some downsides to Columbia as well...
- Business school is expensive and NYC is expensive, put them together and you end up paying a painful amount of money. You pay a premium for being in NY for sure, so if you aren't getting value out of that location then you can probably get a lot of the positives of Columbia somewhere cheaper.
- It is generally understood that our marketing professors aren’t very good. My core marketing class was painful and electives were generally taught by mediocre visiting professors – pretty disappointing when you see the industry legends teaching the finance courses.
- The facilities are...for lack of a better word...bad. It is small and below the standards I would expect from such a great school. Very few dining options and the library is pretty consistently overrun by undergrads.
Tough answering whether it is worth it right out of school (especially for me since I am still on the job hunt). I would say that if you have a good sense of what you want to get out of it and you focus on that it will be worth it (but since priorities vary so much person to person it is also very easy to get distracted).",,,
Columbia,GMAT Club,"Definitely a top school with a rigorous course load meant to prepare you for business application and solid recruiting networks; however, there a lot to be said for up-and-coming b-schools who are quickly gaining a great alumni base and $$$ and trying to lure good candidates w/ scholarship and shiny new facilities and perks. Be prepared to trade off the NYC-location for slightly less than lackluster facilities and on campus dining/catering (understandable considering NYC is so expensive, but trust me, Uris is not what you would think a top-10 school would look like). Regardless of what the infrastructure is looking like now, the school probably trumps most other similarly ranking schools just based on location. At no other school (except Stern) are you able to network so quickly and closely with both alums and recruiter. Actually beneficial in-semester internships are also a huge plus which wouldn't be available at most schools.",,,
Columbia,GMAT Club,"CBS is big on CBS. If you want to go here, you have to be very clear about why. The career resources are excellent, students and alumni are so happy to help, and just using the Columbia name can get you a call or coffee chat with anyone in the industry of your choice. The world is your oyster here. Take advantage of everything New York has to offer, and the huge (40,000+) alumni database.
The social life here is unparalleled. It's been three months and we've already gone to Cancun as a class, had a Gatsby themed Fall Ball and gotten together for dinners, potlucks, sushi and various other gatherings. Columbia's greatest strength is it's awesome, friendly people!

If you are not from a business or ""traditional"" background and are recruiting for banking or consulting, the first semester is EXTREMELY difficult and overwhelming. I would take online courses before school, especially in Excel (if you did not use it in your previous job) so you can feel like you are somewhat on par with your classmates. While CBS has grade non-disclosure, this means you want to fall somewhere in the middle to make sure you are in good academic standing. The ""curve"" makes this very difficult for people who are new to the rigorous core curriculum. Do your best to prepare before school; there simply isn't enough time when you start classes and recruiting to do it all.

Recruiting is extremely well run and CBS will walk you through the process. Join any professional club that is geared toward an industry of interest. They have incredible resources at your disposal. It may be hyper competitive, but everyone will get a job in the end - and a great one at that!

Columbia,GMAT Club,"Although it has been only my first quarter, it already feels like it's been an eternity. In this time I've come to greatly appreciate my classmates, the faculty members, and the resources that are made available to all MBA students. The school does an incredible job of inducting new students into the school, and ensuring that they'll be accommodated an integrated well into the student body.

The Career Management Center takes charge within the first few weeks, and starts educating students in terms of the opportunities available comma and the work that needs to be done in order to get the internship that the students would like.

The professors and faculty members are extremely accommodating, knowledgeable and know their subject well. I was particularly surprised by their ability to integrate humour into classroom situations and to draw on the classroom experience to enrich the case or concept at hand.

The school's location is most definitely one of its key advantages. Just by being in New York City you get to experience so many different things, network with the decision-makers at firms, and hear from industry leaders and experts. I personally got a chance to spend an hour with the global managing director of McKinsey & Co, Mr. Dominic Barton.

Overall, I am extremely glad that I chose the school.",,,
Columbia,GMAT Club,"Going to CBS and participating in the Value Investing Program was easily the best career and life decision I've ever made. I had heard a great deal about the program before I attended but it vastly exceeded my expectations. The quality of students, and even more importantly the faculty and adjunct faculty, cannot be overstated. I was learning directly from some the greatest investors of our generation and that would not have been possible at any other b-school. The opportunity to supplement your learning through internships at NYC hedge funds is huge - this was a key part of my and my fellow investing-oriented classmates education. If you know you want to work on the buyside or any investing-related role, there is no doubt in my mind that CBS is the best place for you.

Every hedge/mutual fund you can think of recruits or has recruited on campus. More importantly, due to CBS' extensive alumni network, you can make in-roads with any fund you want and get in front of them - the rest is up to you. The opportunity is there if you are willing to do the work and put in the time and effort.
",,,
Columbia,GMAT Club,"My CBS MBA enabled me to make a career switch into consulting and eventually to start my own (successful) business. Neither would have been possible without the skills, network and confidence the school allowed me to develop.

I was a J-term student: a path I choose primarily because, although I'm American, I had spent nearly all of my adult life out of the US and wanted to be part of a more international community. For a US school, I would say that Columbia ranks at the top f international experience / outlook. (The J-term was about 50% international). I live in London now, and there is a great group of alumni here as well.

It is true that Columbia is most known for its strength is in finance - an area in which I held little interest. That said, I took some great classes in subjects across the board. The ability to choose electives in other programs at Columbia University also provided a unique opportunity to enhance the traditional b-school curriculum with classes in other academic programs that are also among the top rated, both in the US and globally. (The School of Journalism, Teachers College, etc).

Culture-wise, even with such a high contingent of international students, I did find the experience to be quite ""American"" (for lack of a better term). Not necessarily a bad thing, it was just a little adjustment for me to go from chateau champagne parties at INSEAD (where I worked previously) to college-grade beer in student halls at Columbia.

We passed grade non-disclosure the year I was there, and I found the community to be very supportive and, with a few exceptions (there's always one), not overly competitive.

I left the program with lifelong friendships and a business network upon which I draw regularly. Classmates have become both clients and customers, as well as open sounding-boards as we work to explore more business opportunities.",,,
Columbia,GMAT Club,"My first suggestion would be to evaluate schools based on what current students say. Talking to people is the best way to figure out if the school is a good fit for you. There are a lot of stereotypes about schools online that get perpetuated by people who know the stereotype but don't actually know the school.

I had a truly wonderful experience at Columbia. It is a larger school so allows you to be a part of a diverse group with a lot of different backgrounds and a part of an alumni network that is that much larger. It was amazing to meet people from all over the world and with such varied experiences and backgrounds. As large as the student body is, it is still tight-knit and feels much more manageable given the cluster system and the way that you get to meet people through clubs, activities, and recruiting.

One thing that I was nervous about due to stereotypes I read before school was the culture. The stuff I read (and am hoping still doesn't get put out there) could not have been more wrong. I couldn't believe how supportive my classmates and learning teammates were in their willingness to help me both academically and in terms of my career. The community is incredibly strong. Nearly everyone who is there wants to be there and wants to take advantage of the two years. I don't think being in NYC worked against that. It just meant we had more options available to us for our outside of school activities.

In terms of the NYC location, I would say the only negative is that it is really expensive. B School is already expensive and the money you're going to spend on rent/activities/meals/subway will be that much more in NYC. I would say that there also are so many trips/events that happen at school so there is a bit of pressure to spend money if you want to feel like you're fully involved in the community. While this isn't necessarily the way everyone feels, I would point out that some of my friends felt that way. This is especially true in second year as there is a lot more time to travel and you often find yourself on trips with 70+ classmates.

Other than the cost, I couldn't think of a better location to go to business school especially if you're looking to stay on the east coast after school. Because of the NYC location, a lot of our professors are business professionals as well as professors. Not only does this give a unique perspective to what we're learning, but I also had many professors who said they wanted to help people in the class find jobs and were successful in setting classmates up with opportunities. Classes can also get more real-world perspective through projects/internships. I had friends in a venture capital class where each student was given a VC internship for the semester; that sort of experience can't happen everywhere! In addition, there are always business leaders passing through New York, so the companies and the leaders that come to school are just fantastic. I would also add that took advantage of the small business consulting program which gave me really great experience that I leveraged as I made my career switch.

I found the academics at CBS to average, some classes were great, some were just ok. I was so thankful for grade non-disclosure which was something that I didn't originally consider when looking at Bschools. Not only does it help just get rid of that extra layer of stress, but it really makes people that much more willing to help, there is no competition at all.

I really can't say enough about my experience there, I left with lifelong relationships and having secured a job with a company that I had pinpointed before even starting b-school.",,,
Columbia,GMAT Club,"CBS is a great program, with amazing faculty, career opportunities and speaker series. CBS is what you expect, it's THE school in Manhattan, which means you have a revolving door of world class speakers / leaders as well as job opportunities that are simply impossible to get if you're not in NYC.

What it's not. It's not a community school. Don't get me wrong, a great sense of community but when you compare it to other programs, as i've done with friends at other schools, it simply can't match the cohesiveness of community. Why? two major reason, 1) the facilities are simply too small, too dated, too spread out, too inadequate and 2) it's NYC, people have limitless options for things to do, so getting the class together is simply tough.

The professors are genuinely awesome. They care, they're working hard for you, they make time for you and they understand that business school is a hybrid product - class work, recruiting, social, networking, etc.

The curriculum is strong and getting stronger though the best classes are tough to get and the schedule for some reason leans heavy on MW class (perhaps due to student interest)

You have to understand a few things about CBS... it's a business... it's a business school. I get a feeling / vibe / inkling that the office of student affairs really doesn't give two craps about the students once we are here. They are in the business of placing you in jobs, getting you good course work, building a world class network. This is not the bschool program that is going to hold your hand or tell you you're special. Some people love this, some hate it, I think it's fair though I don't really appreciate it (esp. with a $200k sticker price). In short, this program will get you wherever you want to go career wise and the NYC benefit is true and tangible but it comes at a slight cost to community and facilities that are simply... how do i put this... simply unacceptable.",,,
Columbia,GMAT Club,"On the career front the program at CBS is well designed and I would highly recommend it to anybody interested in Finance and Consulting. The major consulting companies all recruit on campus and the alumni base in finance is incredibly active. Many students have internships during the school year because there are no classes on Fridays. Getting that chance to work for a hedge fund during class can be the difference for many in getting the job they want at graduation. The school is also strengthening the tech/entrepreneurship offerings with a new startup lab. The venture market is New York is growing rapidly and many students start a business with their classmates before reaching graduation.

On the social front the school is very active. The cluster system gives a core group of students you will know well and they travel together, go drinking together and take classes together. The city has more opportunities than you can possibly take advantage of with your limited time. Despite many students having already lived in NYC they still are very active in the school's social scene. The reputation of people scattering after classes is unfounded.

The Core curriculum is not difficult but provides a good foundation and gives the clusters a great chance to bond in their first semester. The electives have a broad selection and the Value Investing Program is unmatched at any other school for access to hedge funds and real world applicability.

All the major banks, consulting firms and large mutual funds recruit on campus. Hundreds of other smaller companies post to the school's job board but non-traditional career paths (healthcare and retail in particular) need to spend a good amount of time networking on their own to find opportunities.",,,
Columbia,Niche,"great but can be better, very diluted cohort, people come in from various backgrounds but lack that intellectual hunger you find in undergrad, conversations in the clusters are very shallow",,,
Columbia,Niche,"Thus far, I have quite liked my experience (the campus is new, the people are diverse and down to earth, and there are plenty of good resources). However, the ""core curriculum"", which lasts mostly throughout the first semester, has too many assignments that students do not get a lot of downtime for professional and personal development.",,,
Columbia,Niche,Columbia Business School curriculum is rigorous however the supportive team dynamic creates an environment which success almost feels guaranteed.,,,
Columbia,Niche,"Professors are engaging, and willing to connect with students so long as you show initiative. You have to seek them out.",,,
Columbia,Niche,The school relies heavily on its Ivy League reputation as an excuse to be very disorganized at the administrative level.,,,
Yale,GMAT Club,"As others have mentioned, SOM is a highly passionate and mission-driven institution. I've been consistently inspired by my peers and in awe of what they seek to accomplish with their MBA education for business and society. The student body culture, in my opinion, is another defining hallmark of the SOM experience--folks here genuinely care about each other's personal and professional success. Given that it's Yale, academic excellence is expected and the curriculum/workload can be rigorous at times, though there is a robust support system in place. In terms of recruiting, a large number of students pursue finance and consulting, though others also have technology, non-profit, and entrepreneurial interests.

For future applicants, I'd suggest reaching out to current students to gain deeper insight into the community. Don't be afraid to contact Admissions Ambassadors or Club Leaders!
",,,
Yale,GMAT Club,"Few opportunities come around that are as life-changing as the Silver Scholar program at SOM was for me - the Silver Scholars program is for students straight out of undergrad to pursue an MBA at SOM. I matriculated in 2012 with the class of 2014 and, due to the parameters of the program, spent two years working full-time at my dream company, and then returned to SOM to complete my final year of courses and study and graduate in 2016. I believe that the Silver Scholars program is representative of the forward-looking direction of SOM and the fact that the institution is not afraid to take risks and innovate.

Over these four years that I was in the program, I was able to see SOM evolve into an even more global business school, with the maturation of the Global Network for Advanced Management. During my second year, I was proud to count over 50% of the student population from different countries, providing a distinctly global feel. Many of my closest friends were from foreign countries and now I feel grateful to have friends from all over the world.

The most remarkable thing about SOM is the community - not just our small and large learning teams, our cohort, our class, or our school, but the fact that SOM strives to be the most closely-integrated business school with it's parent university, which translates into one of the highest percentages of joint-degree candidates and the flexibility to take as many of our electives outside of SOM as you wish. I made countless of friends from SOM, but also from Yale College, the Jackson Institute, the School of Public Health, and the Law School, just to name a few.

This, combined with the immensely tight-knit alumni community that has among the highest rates of annual alumni contributions to their alma mater, makes me confident that I made the right choice - a choice that will continue to pay dividends and a school that I can count on for the duration of my professional career and beyond.

Coming from a social sciences and public policy background in undergrad, SOM's core curriculum provided me the business tools and frameworks to serve as a Senior Manager in the Research and Development division of the company that I returned to after the conclusion of my MBA.

I am grateful for the distinct attention that SOM professors provide their students - frequently going above and beyond the call of duty in helping individuals like me - who overdid it during one of our one-week intensive modules, and got pneumonia. My professors were very understanding and took time to help bring me up to speed, one-on-one on course material, even though they taught hundreds of students at the time. This example is representative of the fact that Professors are passionate about their work and research, but doubly so about teaching students at SOM. I never expected to regularly head over to Professor's houses for tea, or see them at weekly hackathons/pizza parties. SOM professors dedicated to getting to know the students, and ever since I graduated, keep in touch with us as well.",,,
Yale,GMAT Club,"Yale SOM has been a solid experience thus far. I'm currently a 2nd-semester first-year student. The core curriculum is excellent at integrating multiple perspectives. You must do readings for class, or will find that you're not learning much, as much of class time is reserved for discussions of cases.

Evans Hall, the sole facility of Yale SOM, is a high-tech, brand-new building. Visually, it's an incredible place.

The Career office is incredibly helpful for career coaching needs. School seems to land a high number of IB and Consulting internships which do convert successfully into full-time job offers.

While the student body seems low on quant skills, I am hoping that quant-focused electives do not shy away from challenging the student body (I have not yet completed any electives, as we just began them last week).

New Haven is a great city. Good restaurants, and lots of young people (most of whom are yale-affiliated in some way)

Core curriculum is low on quant topics, and most quant-heavy courses (Sourcing & Managing Funds, Operations Engine) have dedicated TA-led weekly review sessions (likely because the student body as a whole seems less comfortable with quantitative topics and needs the extra help).

I did not recruit for IB, but heard anecdotally that most students interested in IB land an offer due to the relatively small number of students hoping to go into banking. The Consulting Club is top-notch at preparing students for case interviews and teh consulting process.
",,,
Yale,GMAT Club,"Fantastic program, enabled me to meet my personal and professional goals for b-school. I had an MBB internship and will be returning, have had the opportunity to lead clubs, and to meet CEOs of F500 companies - both in large part due to the smaller class size at Yale. I've also had the opportunity to take a class at Yale Law, as well as Yale college. Excellent facilities, and an improving faculty. The b-school is definitely going places - each year the incoming class seems better than the last, and recruiting outcomes are also on a positive trajectory, particularly in consulting.",,,
Yale,GMAT Club,"I have been most impressed by the facilities at the school. The SOM campus is breathtaking but I also like the fact that you are not just limited to SOM. You can connect with any part of the wider university. In addition, I really did not expect the level of diversity I have encountered in the school. The school is soooooooo diverse but yet very friendly and collaborative. As an international student, it is highly recommended. However, if you are looking to incubate a business idea, I am not sure SOM is doing a lot in that regard. Entrepreneurship is almost at the back end and you will need extra self-motivation to continue in this track.",,,
Yale,GMAT Club,"Positives:
The community is great. Everyone is very supportive, grade non-disclosure totally matters and helps keep the class from being competitive from each other in a negative way. There are plenty of interesting electives, and if you have anything else you're interested in, there is access to all other parts of Yale (I took a full year of Spanish at the college, for example). Joint degrees are all over the place and always bring an interesting perspective. Consulting is killing it, banking and tech do very well, and the people outside those three top industries often seem to find interesting and unusual work.

Negatives:
As it is a newer school with a slightly smaller alumni network than its peer schools, some of the niche areas (PE/VC, IM) are harder to break into, just by virtue of having fewer people to talk to. I certainly wouldn't mind shortening the core as well. While the focus on the non-profit sector is totally overblown on GMATClub, we do lack some of the really top business backgrounds in the class- not too many from high finance or MBB for example.



Overall: I still think Yale is a buy-low opportunity. Classes have only gotten stronger over the past 15 years or so, and as those alums move up in their jobs the PEVC opportunities will start to come, and the alumni network will become much more powerful. The amount of access to people here is amazing- I went to a speaker session last semester that included John Kerry, Hank Paulson, and Jeff Immelt, and that's just one of the examples of the types of access that Yale as a university can get you.
",,,
Yale,GMAT Club,"One of the reasons I joined SOM was because of its upward trajectory in the last few years. Being here I can truly feel that I am a part of something special. We have classmates who gave up positions at higher ranked schools (no scholarship was not a decision making factor) to be a part of this amazing school. The class itself is amazing, with folks from all across the globe with all kinds of experiences. Everyone is supportive, and you feel like you are a part of the family.

The one areas where SOM can improve though is their placement in the tech sector. But I guess our location is not doing us any favors in that regards.",,,
Yale,GMAT Club,"The community at Yale SOM is simply amazing. You get to meet people from all over the world and the pool of students is very diverse. In addition to being diverse, everyone has stellar academics and past professional experiences. A truly amazing setting to grow and learn over 2 years.

Whether it is during recruiting or exam season, everyone is helping each other and as a far as I know everyone got the job they wanted from the MBA. It opened me doors to work in top consulting and tech firms in the US during my internship and after graduation. This was one of my main goal coming from Europe.

The fact that SOM is embedded in the greater Yale also helps to expand your learning reach. You can take classes at the law school or any other school on campus.

Finally, New Haven is not New York or Boston but has its benefits. You get to spend a ton of time with your classmates and create deep relationships (since yale is pretty much everything that exists in new haven). It also saves you on expenses since food and rent are much cheaper than in a larger US city.
",,,
Yale,GMAT Club,"Folks here are exceptionally smart, driven, and diverse. This is obviously the case with many other top programs as well, but the student body here truly resonates with SOM's mission of educating leaders ""for business and society"". From a career perspective, SOM is particularly strong at sending folks to consulting careers. The much-allured MBB has solidified its presence on campus, and SOM is now considered a core target school for these firms as well as many other consulting firms (Deloitte, Monitor, Parthenon, etc.). The consulting club in particular is especially helpful (it is run like another class) and is structured in a way to maximize success during case interviews.

For other careers (finance, general management, IB), SOM isn't quite as strong yet - as the school continues to build out its reputation though this should change over time. Recruiting within these industries isn't quite as structured and will require a bit more elbow grease on your part. If you put in the effort to network (and take advantage of Yale's brand), you should be okay.

From a curriculum perspective, SOM's integrated curriculum is honestly a hyped-up version of the typical core curriculum offered by other top programs. The big difference here is the ""raw case"" approach (where we are given ALL of the data rather than a subset of case data) , but I'm not sure how valuable this difference is. Electives so far have been good - SOM does have a solid list of professors (John Kerry, Tim Geithner, Jim Chanos, etc.) so the electives can be good.",,,
Yale,GMAT Club,"The overall experience has been great! The small class size along with the perspective based core curriculum really make the first year a very engaging and enriching experience academically.

If you are looking for an environment where collaboration and group work is encouraged, this is the place! Literally everything (except finals) is group based so you get a LOT of opportunities to develop your teamwork and communication skills.

I would recommend future applicants to consider the type of school environment as well as broader social environment they want to be in. New Haven is a small town and there isn't too much to do outside of campus so a lot of the social activities end up being with your classmates.",,,
Yale,GMAT Club,"I came into the EMBA with about 10 years of experience in Marketing and a Director role. The program is very high quality, with a lot of attention on the students.
The reason I chose the school was that it was an actual MBA, with the same classes, faculty and class hours as the full-time MBA. I also chose Yale SOM because the curriculum has a great mix of academic classes and more practical workshop-style classes, which makes it easy to bring the learning back to the office on Monday after class.
The school has a unique perspective and philosophy of business and leadership, that they infuse in the teaching and community - and that's very encouraging for those who aspire to lead effectively and make a difference through their business ventures.
The class is a very cohesive group of well-rounded professionals, all senior in their fields, and extremely supportive of each other's growth. The admission team does an excellent job keeping the program relatively small, and being very selective, by making sure they only admit people who will do something great with their MBA. After a year in the class, it really feels like everybody has been growing individually, but also that we have grown as a group.
All in all, it is an excellent program for professionals looking to broaden their understanding of business and gain a more holistic understanding of leadership. Get ready to work very hard though, as the classes are extremely demanding.",,,
Yale,GMAT Club,"I thought it was an eye-opening, expansive experience as far as my understanding of traditional top-tier MBA programs go. The student body is warm, incredibly bright, fascinating background-wise, and motivated to help each other get through the rigors of the first year curriculum. The curriculum itself is a bit too theoretical and not practical, even though as an intellectually oriented person I found everything fascinating and new. The real benefit in my experience was the amount of people from unconventional backgrounds who had to band together and really help each other out, and those bonds have lasted past business school for sure.

As I was looking to go into food and beverage niches post-graduation, the program was a nice mark on my resume and profile as a candidate for some positions and opportunities, but not directly correlated with my ability to find opportunities. It was a lot of DIY for me, granted I was going into a niche area.

It's very academic in terms of the main subject areas, and while fascinating, does not always lend itself to post-MBA practical skills. but I believe it is being fine-tuned for more of a practical orientation.
",,,
Yale,GMAT Club,"Yale SOM has an amazing community. People are really down-to-earth and humble. The fact that the class is small also add values. You know almost everyone in your class and connections are deep.
Campus recruitment cell need to improve dramatically though. It has a traditional focus on Consulting and Investment Banking and much of it is driven by the clubs at campus and not by career services.
There also seems to be less structure and coordination between different departments. For instance there is a course during the first week of Jan which asks students to be present on campus despite vacations or job interviews.",,,
Yale,GMAT Club,"Overall, Yale offers a very emotionally supportive environment that is tailored to students and how they feel. They expend many resources on trying to improve the student experience. The courses are low pressure, and grades are not important/not emphasized and your GPA is not shared. However, this program lacks diversity in terms of thought. Many students are very left (liberal) and there is not a conservative perspective that is taught/moderated by professors. This can lead to a frustrating perspective that only represents one ideology which is not realistic. Overall though, the resources are vast, and the reputation and connections will help you get into your desired industry easily if you put in the effort.

Some courses can be very poorly taught, and the knowledge you extract is based on your work effort. You can get by with a proficient with minimal effort, but may not learn much if you do not put in the effort.",,,
Yale,GMAT Club,"The student body is second to none. My classmates made my experience at Yale a fantastic one. They elevated me, helped me, and became my close friends.
As far as I know, Yale is becoming more and more selective. We are starting to see more and more classmates who would have otherwise end up at CBS, Kellogg, Booth, Sloan, and even Wharton if not for Yale's recent meteoric rise in ranking and publicity. As such, quality of students should continue to increase.
The curriculum can be difficult at times, as Yale is particularly strict academic wise. You'll need to prioritize and choose two our of academics, career, and socializing. I picked the latter two because I have a business background and could get by without pounding the books.
Banking, finance, and consulting recruiting is strong. Others are weaker but starting to pick up, particularly in tech.
Close to NYC and Boston. Easy to hope on a train and meet with people in those cities.
Bay Area presence really starting to pick up.",,,
Yale,GMAT Club,"If you already know what you want from your MBA or career after, you may have already made up your mind and have already crossed Yale off your list or looking forward to the admit call but If you don't, this is the place for you.

The batch size is perfect - not too small that you will lack diversity, and not too big that you have to compete for resources. School's impetus on integrated curriculum and integration with other Yale School's help you find your own career trajectory. This is especially helpful for those who find themselves force fitting in one of the many traditional well-trodden career paths. The integration with parent university gives you access to the wider network of Yale alums which is really helpful.

The school location might be a challenge for those looking to recruit for I-Banking. 2 hour weekly rides (for networking/company event) each way to New York is not fun but manageable. But then, for international students who have never been in the States, it's an easy transition into the American culture here at New Haven. Yale SOM has a new state of the art building. Consulting Companies have a need found liking to the school which I will owe to the money they have invested in the upgrading the facilities.

The student body at Yale SOM is really powerful and work very closely with the administration to have any student issues resolved. The school takes the matter of diversity - gender, ethnicity, sexual orientation etc. very seriously. Given the relatively small size of the batch, you can easily get a position of responsibility in any of the professional/student interest clubs which will help you hone your leadership capabilities and work on your personal network. There are over 80 clubs at SOM. Not to mention the ones available at your disposal at the broader University level.

Another gem in SOM's crown is the GNAM Network. It's a global network of 29 B-schools aimed at a seamless flow of information, knowledge, and experiences. You can do online classes at peer school or do a semester abroad or visit them for networking weeks throughout the years. If you are looking for a global career, this is a goldmine for you. The access and opportunities this network provides are unparallel. I personally was able to find myself internship opportunities through this network.

If you are looking to recruit for consulting, don't think twice this is the school for you. Close to 20% of the class of 2018 was recruited by MBB (Mckinsey Bain & BCG) for the internship. I am not counting other consulting companies here. This is really high if you compare to any other b-school.",,,
Yale,GMAT Club,"It surpassed my expectations. The professors' knowledge and experience is beyond words. We even had professors we Nobel prizes. Each class had a different focus that enabled us to become great negotiatiors, managers, markets and even more. Classmates were also great. Our class was very diverse (40% international). This helped me understand different points of view, see things with a new scope and expand my culture. The university campus is also amazing, full of history. You are also able to take classes on any of Yale's schools (law, deama, architecture), which is a big plus! It's the best decision I have ever made
",,,
Yale,GMAT Club,"I chose SOM to transition from traditional consulting to social impact consulting. Some observations:
- SOM is extremely strong for social impact, especially given quality of classmates (many with nonprofit backgrounds), courses offered (e.g. took ""Managing Social Enterprises"", ""Strategic Management of Nonprofit Organizations"" and ""Nonmarket Strategy"" this last semester) and focus on ""business & society"" even in core (accounting, finance, etc) more so than other programs
- Social impact careers are available; financial support through Loan Forgiveness Program for full-time and Internship Fund for summer are great, and there are some former classmates who landed nonprofit jobs with $100k+ salaries (quite an aspiration)
- In addition, all top consulting companies recruit here (got MBB interviews coming up) as well as many of the smaller ones
- Connection to wider Yale is incredible and easy to facilitate; I took graduate classes with School of Forestry and Environment, Global Affairs, School of Music, Philosophy Department, and undergrad classes on Fractal Geometry and Astronomy (at the observatory)
- Student life is great; many events, the student clubs are very active with something for everyone, and the parties are fun
- New Haven is not as bad as one would think: There are many offerings, especially cultural (musicals, concerts, theatre, museums, etc) and culinary; and if one still gets bored, NYC is",,,
Yale,GMAT Club,"Yale's mission is to educate leaders for business to society. This really shows in the student body - the type of student that applies and is accepted here tends to want to make the world a better place. This a big strength and point of differentiation for the program. Others include a general feeling that Yale is improving - through better class attributes, diversity of experiences, and some amazing and very accomplished incoming professors. Others strengths include the Yale brand and ability to take courses at Yale college and the law school, as well as required international experiences while a student here. The main downside for the school is that New England winters are truly brutal.",,,
Yale,GMAT Club,"very friendly student body, but infantilizing culture. Finance classes seem great but many employer institutions have not fully bought into that ""brand."" still strong selection for those interested in non profits and social sector, and I think the school and students are getting better at critically addressing the more difficult, uncomfortable parts of educating leaders for business and SOCIETY. For example, talking up the need for environmental friendliness is easy but what about intersectional discrimination that isn't purposeful but happens every day in the workplace, school, etc? I think this is a hard goal that is both made better and yet hampered by a push for rapid increase in global diversity - this comes with good and bad.
",,,
Yale,GMAT Club,"Great experience. Very smart, thoughtful students. Not necessarily the vapid corporate types you find at a lot of business schools. Strong social sector community, but most of the class still ends up in private sector jobs. Consulting, banking, tech, the usual. Strong LGBTQ scene. Highest proportion of self-identified LGBTQ students of all of the top business schools.

SOM is very integrated into the rest of the university as well. You can take classes at law school, environmental science school, health, undergrad. Strong community.

New Haven is okay. Lots of restaurants and bars. I like the being in New Haven forces business school students to be involved and engaged with each other and campus life.",,,
Yale,GMAT Club,"The Yale SOM experience is an all-including experience. You join the SOM community from the first day you set foot on-campus, and immediately you are immersed with your fellow students, the faculty members, and staff. As anything you do, the experience is dependent on how much effort you put into it -- and you'll see that Yale SOM students put their hearts and souls into the school and into the community. I am always amazed at how much everyone cares for each other, helps other students through interview processes, and genuinely cares about each other. My friends (from other business schools and non bschool students) all comment at how ""nice"" and ""grounded"" Yale SOM students are and how much they differ from the stereotype of business school in general. I am proud of that. Yale SOM is a special place, and the people make it so.

Faculty is a huge aspect of my SOM experience. They know your names, your background, your interests. They encourage students to take courses regardless of your experience -- they take the time to make sure you're learning what you WANT to learn, what you're interested in ... and give you the opportunity to shape your business experience. And they get to know you outside of class through barbecues at their houses, workouts at the gym, and hanging out at SOM. I think one aspect of what makes SOM special is that everyone realizes each person in Evans Hall and across the Yale campus is a person -- each person has a story to bring and many layers of personality and interests. Together we make up the Yale community and we all want to contribute to that.",,,
Yale,Niche,"The Yale School of Management's MBA program is amazing. The professors are phenomenal experts in their fields, and that is in addition to a supportive career development office that works to ensure that every student finds an internship and eventual post-graduate job that meets their needs and passions.",,,
Yale,Niche,"The academic rigor is there but there isn't enough investment in supporting students from non-traditional backgrounds (e.g., underrepresented students or students with no finance or technical experience). What they offer, such as Math camp (by invitation only) and online modules prior to the start of the program, does not prepare us to meet the rigor of the program. In terms of community, the students are widely supported in various efforts and given certain liberties (e.g., starting new student org on racial equity etc.). However, in terms of fostering a sense of belonging, there is room for improvement. Also, school administration lacks a cultural identity for the community that they stand united on that informs how they interact with students.",,,
Yale,Niche,"Wonderful classmates who were smart and engaging, but who I also wanted to grab a beer with. Extremely accomplished professors who really cared about teaching, not just publishing new research.",,,
