UPenn,GMAT Club,"The Wharton MBA program has the deepest curriculum I could think off in finance. Moreover, the school provides training and access to all the top wall street courses to help folks from non-finance transition to finance.

In terms of visibility from employers, banking, consulting and investing are all hot on recruiting. If you network well with the employer, put in the right effort, and do all your prep thoroughly - I don’t think there's much stopping you from getting your dream job. Obviously, things have been a bit harder this year, but even then, relatively its much stronger than other schools.

Overall, I’d say if you want to pivot to banking or investing (PE/HF/Long Only Investing), you have the best resources in terms of clubs and classes to make this happen for you, and have all the top employers you would imagine coming on campus to hire you.

For me, the school helped me meet the needs to transition to an investing role (at least for summer) in the US.

As a future applicant, I’d say focus on displaying your quantitative aptitude. For what its worth people are very sharp, and you want to showcase yourself to be up there and do enough research to get to know the school and resources. I am six months in and still learning more about Penn and the offerings of the MBA program. Speak to enough people and get a good sense of how you want to spend your time here.",,,,deepest class finance moreover provides training access wall street class folk nonfinance transition finance semester visibility employer finance consulting investing hot job network employer put right hard prep thoroughly there stopping getting dream job obviously bit harder relatively stronger id pivot finance investing pehflong investing resource semester activity class happen employer imagine coming location hire helped transition investing role least summer u future id displaying quantitative aptitude worth sharp showcase enough research resource six month learn penn job speak enough sense spend time,0
UPenn,GMAT Club,"Wharton is excellent when it comes to the brand, alumni network, and faculty. I am part of the HCM program and I was pleasantly surprised by the opportunities and connections that the program provides. I knew going in that the network is solid but never could I have ever imagined the true power of the alumni network. You really have to experience it to know the full extent to which it helps.
The classes so far have been really great even in COVID times. The school is trying really hard to make the classes engaging given the situation. Definitely very rigorous and quant heavy. Everything is solved analytically in classes.
Classmates and the community is real. Even during COVID most of the class is in Philly that helped us bond in a socially distanced manner.

UPenn,GMAT Club,"My time so far at Wharton has been enriching from an academic standpoint as I have found the profs very impressive, and most of the course work relevant to my future goals. Additionally, I feel that Wharton has put me in a strong position for recruiting into IB as the structured recruiting process has made connecting with banks and bankers easier than expected.

Unfortunately, COVID-19 has made networking with my peers and making friends more challenging than it should be, and the lack of club activity definitely hurts.

UPenn,GMAT Club,"I have been admitted to Wharton's Class of 2020. I have been very satisfied with my experience and exposure in the school so far. Wharton has a very dedicated staff working constantly to provide the best student experience. They have a huge focus on 'maximizing Wharton experience' and are committed to achieving this target. I was amazed by the way they have effectively and efficiently managed a class size of 800, ensuring sufficient networking opportunities in both small and large group settings. The school is committed to help you not only get the best professional career path, but grow as an individual. Wharton has an approx. 3 weeks of pre-class program, where the intent is to familiarize the student with the different school resources and work on one's teamwork & leadership skills. This ensured that I had sufficient time to settle down in school, and not feel overwhelmed with the various resources/ opportunities available. Wharton also has its flagship course on 'Teamwork and Leadership' which is specifically focused on teaching managers to build effective teams via a patented simulation analysis. For career services, the school does not allow employeer chats/ session in the first quarter, so that students get sufficient time to prepare. The school has a dedicated career services team which is divided basis the various industries. We can book regular advising sessions with them, and clarify all our doubts over mail as well. They are very responsive. For student life, the school has a club for everything you can possibly imagine. So it's important to be clear with the intent of pursuing a certain activity. In short, I am pleasantly very pleased with Wharton's overall culture. Everyone is very nice, and tries to help each other. The school has a huge focus on teamwork which gets reflected in all the course assignments that we get. One opportunity area could be in terms of student diversity. The school is filled with consultants and bankers.",,,,admitted class 2020 satisfied experience exposure location dedicated staff working constantly provide experience maximizing experience committed achieving target amazed effectively efficiently managed class size 800 ensuring sufficient network job large team setting committed professional job path grow individual approx 3 week preclass intent familiarize resource work team leadership skill ensured sufficient time settle overwhelmed various resource job available flagship class team leadership specifically focused teaching manager build effective team via patented simulation analysis job service allow employeer chat session semster sufficient time prepare dedicated job service team divided basis various industry book regular advising session clarify doubt mail responsive life activity everything possibly imagine important clear intent pursuing certain activity short pleasantly pleased culture everyone try team reflected class assignment job location semester diverse filled consulting banker,5
UPenn,GMAT Club,"I started my own company during Wharton and have been working on it full-time since. Wharton prepared me well for all aspects of startup life. I have relied a ton on the Wharton network and have always been amazed by how helpful classmates are. The Philly Entrepreneurship system continues to grow rapidly. Definitely make sure you join both Founder's Club and the Entrepreneurship Club!
Courses are also a great way to get free help from brilliant classmates on your startup.

UPenn,GMAT Club,"I am extremely happy at Wharton. Philadelphia is a great place to go to school. You get the resources of a city, but on top of that, everyone lives within a mile radius, creating a tight new community. Everyone embraces the “My Wharton” mentality, making the most of what they want of the experience. Whether you want to focus on classes, clubs, social life or family, there is a place and plentiful opportunity for you. The classes, especially the electives, have great content and professors. All of the top consulting firms and investment banks come to Wharton, and the clubs/career services do a great job preparing you for those interviews.

UPenn,GMAT Club,"Prior to business school I worked at a hedge fund but knew I wanted to get into management and operations. High priority for me was getting into the best school I could and Wharton was my #1 choice. Why over H/S and others? It came down to people; of all the alumni from the schools I knew, I got along best with Wharton people and my 3 years did not disappoint.

I'm getting in, best advice is to find someone with 3 characteristics who can help you: they've been through the MBA process successfully, they know you well, and they are candid. If you don't have someone like that in your life then hit on as many as possible. Do your best and forget the rest!

I got an internship and accepted full time with an MBB but had a lot of other unique opportunities in management, startups, and finance. Wharton will be great for 99% of people. The only place it came up a bit short on career oops was in PE and HF, but I believe it would have been the same for all programs given the ad IOC nature of hiring. For anything blue chip, Wharton is great, plus the San Francisco center is an amazing opportunity for those interested in the bay.

Biggest complaint is that the classes are run by academics as opposed to practitioners and the classes feel to academic. I wish the curriculum were more practical.

Socially, the school does a TON to facilitate friendships and invests a lot in the class.

Overall a great program a very happy with my investment and the prospects it is providing me.",,,,prior worked hedge fund knew wanted management operation high priority getting 1 choice h others came network knew got along 3 disappoint getting advice someone 3 characteristic theyve process successfully candid someone life hit possible forget rest got job accepted full time mbb unique job management entrepreneurship finance 99 location came bit short job oops pe hf given ad ioc nature hiring blue chip plus center job bay biggest complaint class run class opposed practitioner class class wish class practical socially facilitate friendship invests class happy investment prospect providing,0
UPenn,GMAT Club,"After the first year of bschool, I will say that it has been a fun experience. I've met some great people and have been able to travel to some fantastic places, however, career wise, I can't say at this point that it's been worth the tuition. Unless you want to go into finance or consulting, the career options post business school may be a bit disappointing and limited. Industries are not as open to career switchers as bschools make them out to be. If you know exactly what you want to do in two years, then you'll hopefully be able to make the most out of your bschool experience.

UPenn,GMAT Club,"Without the Lauder program, I wouldn't have gone to Wharton. With its small group size (~70 students) and amazing international programming, it was an incredible academic, social, and personal experience. As a somewhat introverted person, the huge class size of Wharton was intimidating. Having a solid base of friends and contacts through Lauder made navigating Wharton much easier.

One thing that pleasantly surprised me about Wharton was the lack of competition among students in classes. Thanks to the grade non-disclosure policy, I found my classmates very willing to help one another.

Another huge selling point on Wharton for me is the breadth of the alumni network. While many schools have huge regional concentrations of alumni, Wharton has pretty even global coverage, with obvious hubs in NYC and SF.
If I could change anything about Wharton, it would be the classroom technology policy. I wish Wharton would adopt a full-blown, accross-the-board technology ban in class as is done at HBS. The quality of class participation suffered significantly due to students working on laptops, phones, and tablets during class. It was very distracting. and a shame given the investment we all made to be there.",,,,without lauder wouldnt gone team size 70 international programming class network personal experience somewhat introverted class size intimidating solid base classmate contact lauder navigating easier pleasantly surprised lack competition among class thanks grade nondisclosure policy found classmate another another selling point breadth network regional concentration network pretty international coverage obvious hub change classroom tech policy wish adopt fullblown accrosstheboard tech ban class done quality class participation suffered significantly due working laptop phone tablet class distracting shame given investment,-1
UPenn,GMAT Club,"I applied with a consulting background and a liberal arts undergrad degree. While living in Philly after growing up in California wasnt the best (hello snow!), it was a great college town and the MBA program is really a little bubble within the city, both on campus and where students typically live. The school has an amazing alumni and career management support system, and their healthcare program is top notch. And dont discount brand - everywhere in the world, people know what Wharton is.

Through the program, I was able to land a job at a bulge bracket investment bank fairly easily, so I would say this school is a safe bet if that is the field you are interested in. Finally, the people you will meet are the most smart, well-grounded people EVER.

UPenn,GMAT Club,"There are many things that can be said about Wharton, but the full time MBA program has far exceeded my expectations. My classmates are collegial and supportive, the professors are world class and leaders in their industry, and the amount of career opportunities I've been exposed to is staggering. I was really on the fence between Wharton and another program and would go back and make the same decision again in a heartbeat if I could. Could not be happier with my decision.

The two biggest perks of the program, in my experience, are the student body and the alumni. My classmates have worked in nearly every country on Earth, at nearly every company you could think of, and in an incredibly wide range of roles. If I want to learn more about the McKinsey office in Moscow, I can grab lunch with someone who spent 2 years there tomorrow. If I'm curious about working in a fintech startup in San Francisco, I can grab coffee with someone that was employee #3 at one later today. If I want to know the gritty details about working at Goldman TMT in NYC, I can bump into a person that did that between classes. I didn't fully understand how valuable that level of connection would be until I got here and was able to take advantage of it before the waves of recruiting hit during my first year.

The alumni support has been very impressive. Coming into school, I knew I wanted to work in a certain industry in a certain geographic area, so I started reaching out to alumni from both schools I was considering to get a feel of the strength of each network. The Wharton alumni far and away were the most responsive and receptive to me and several of them went beyond the extra mile to meet or chat with me during my decision process. Since I've been a student, that aspect has only improved. I may be an anomaly, but I've had a hit rate of 100% when it comes to returned emails, phone calls, or coffee / lunch invitations from alumni. I know the burden will be on me someday to repay the favor to the next set of students, but I cannot overstate how strong and open the Wharton network has been for me thus far.

I thought the competition between students would be extremely cutthroat based on what I heard from some of the older alumni at my pre-MBA firm, but that hasn't been true at all. All of my classmates are extremely helpful and there isn't this ""I win if I can make you lose"" mentality like I was expecting. I think the TBD interview style really works to wash out the gunners before they get to campus.

The amount of electives and flexibility you have within the degree programs thanks to the short fixed core classes program is really fantastic. You can get as deep or as broad as you want in any subject and I've really taken advantage of it by using the course catalogue as a shopping menu for classes that I think sound interesting outside my chosen field of study.

WAY more tech firms and start ups recruit at Wharton than I thought would when I was applying. I come from a finance background and plan to continue in the investment field after school, but I've been pleasantly surprised at the amount of opportunity that exists beyond the typical financial roles. The school has a finance reputation for a reason, but there is a big push from the leadership to expand entrepreneurship and tech stuff and it's really starting to show when you look at the post-MBA jobs a lot of people are taking.",,,,said full time location exceeded classmate collegial support professor international class leader industry amount job job exposed staggering fence another back decision heartbeat happier decision biggest perk experience size network classmate worked nearly country earth nearly job wide range role learn mckinsey office moscow grab lunch someone spent 2 tomorrow curious working fintech entrepreneurship grab coffee someone employee 3 later today gritty detail working goldman tmt bump class didnt fully understand valuable level connection got advantage wave job hit network support impressive coming knew wanted work certain industry certain geographic location started reaching network considering strength network network location away responsive receptive several beyond extra mile chat decision process since aspect improved may anomaly hit rate 100 returned email phone call coffee lunch invitation network burden someday repay favor next set cannot overstate strong open network thus location thought competition cutthroat based heard older network premba job hasnt true classmate helpful isnt win lose mentality expecting tbd job style work wash gunner location amount elective flexibility within degree thanks short fixed core class deep broad class taken advantage using class catalogue shopping menu class sound interesting outside chosen field learn tech job start ups job thought applying finance background plan continue investment field pleasantly surprised amount job exists beyond typical finance role finance reputation reason push leadership expand entrepreneurship tech stuff starting show job taking,2
UPenn,GMAT Club,"Wharton has been a great experience, but it has been more difficult than I had expected. There is definite truth when they say that you will have no free time, since classes, clubs, social activities and recruiting take up so much take.

The people are honestly some of the best people I have met - everyone is approachable and willing to help you out, no one sabotages anyone, etc.

Wharton also has a lot more to offer than finance - in fact, I think that more students go into consulting and tech than into finance.

The only complaint I have is that it is too far from where all the students live (or maybe that was our own fault).

To future applicants I would suggest visiting the school and talking to students to really learn what they think, the students are honest and won't sugar coat anything .

UPenn,GMAT Club,"To be honest, most of MBA curriculum can be learned almost anywhere. What's made the difference to me at Wharton is the community. Wharton has an amazing cluster and cohort system that encourages students to get to know each other. It's Philadelphia location and the fact that most students live in Rittenhouse helps foster a sense of community. I can't walk down the street without running into someone I know, which builds the strong relationships I wanted in my MBA experience. I think that's why the alumni network is also so strong. The network is really bi-coastal and international and I've had a lot of help/networking success with alums.

Other highlights at Wharton include the amazing speakers that come to the school, the opportunitues to build up strategy/innovation experience through the field application project program and the collaborative innovation project program, and the Semester in SF program. I've loved my classes with Profs. Adam Grant, David Bell, Luke Taylor, and Bari Harlam.

The professors in general can be a hit or miss. They're generally okay and some of the long term ones seem like they couldn't give a care about teaching. We do have some superstars (see above) and they're very much worth taking a class with.

Also, I'm convinced Philadelphia is one of the most underrated cities in the US. I loved in SF and DC before school (and spent a lot of time in NYC) and absolutely love Philly. It's inexpensive to live in, the food scene is amazing, and it's architecturally beautiful. The weather is typical East Coast weather so winter isn't the best, but can't complain about much else. It's gotten a lot safer in the last few years and I feel safer here than SF.

UPenn,Niche,"Intensive but interesting. Great people, but professor quality varied. Lectures tend to be very interesting, but are high level in some cases. Coming from an engineering background, this felt ""easy"", but it is a different type of learning- more focused on the concepts than proving theories and underlying complexities. TAs are great and there is a lot of effort put towards making students understand the material.

Northwestern,GMAT Club,"Coming from a non traditional background, before Kellogg I could barely use Excel. My previous leadership experiences were very real world and high pressure. The one thing I knew I had to focus on during my MBA was my quantitative skills.

At Kellogg, I took several classes on statistics, analytical decision making, and even coding. For someone who couldn't do a vlookup, I left Kellogg knowing how to code in Stata and R. The best classes for that were Marketing Research, Customer Analytics, and Analytical decision modeling.

Professors were great and extremely helpful in helping me figure out what languages to study and what I could do with the newly-acquired skills.

Northwestern,GMAT Club,"When I applied to business schools, I knew I was looking for a few key things (not necessarily in order):

-- Success with placing students into good consulting careers
-- Supportive/friendly environment
-- Strong brand recognition
-- International opportunities

Kellogg has met my expectations on these criteria and exceeded it in others. Several of the above are things that you can pick up from reading the internet, but to experience it is an entirely different thing.

Sure, Kellogg has great stats when it comes to placing folks into good consulting jobs. However, I didn't realize HOW this happened before coming. The school does a great job of offering equal opportunities for success (particularly through the ""bid"" system, whereby you can bid ""points"" to get an interview with a company even if they didn't choose you). Further, the student body is incredibly supportive -- numerous people have gone out of their way to help me prepare for my interviews. Thanks to this system and environment, I was able to get a job with one of my most desired consulting firms!

The international opportunities have been numerous and incredible. At a certain point there happens to be TOO MANY (if you can believe it) opportunities to travel -- you have to be selective about how you spend your time/money!

But beyond these things, its simply a wonderful community. I've learned a ton from my classes and peers. I've met an incredible number of friendly people who are extraordinarily accomplished already.

Northwestern,GMAT Club,"The most unique aspect of Kellogg School of Management (Northwestern University) is it's social and collaborative spirit. Most classwork is done in groups - including Finance and Accounting assignments - that teaches you to not only work in a group setting but to pull your own weight. This is an essential trait for corporate success, and IMHO all business schools should focus more on this.

I loved getting involved with many organizations and programs while in school. There really was an option for everything. I ended up going with a non traditional career path for recruiting, so the hardest part about my experience was having fewer resources and networking contacts immediately available to me.

Northwestern,GMAT Club,"Kellogg really is the teamwork and marketing school you hear about. Students run everything and are generally very intelligent, outgoing and helpful in all aspects of student life. The vibe is very diverse and inclusive.

Social events start the school year with a frenzy, but as the the first year continues school work and especially recruiting begin to take a bulk of the time and attention of the students. Second year students generally are more laid back, especially after securing their full-time offer.

Classes are challenging if you're coming from a non-traditional background, and easier if you've spent the bulk of your career in a quantitative field. Professors are excellent and available if you want to face-time beyond class. Some people don't take classes very seriously, while others are dying for A's.

The toughest part of the experience is managing time. People told me how hard it would be to balance everything before coming here, but you REALLY feel that once you're here. It's not quite possible to fully prepare for it, but rather just accept it as a way of life, particularly in the first half of the first year. It gets easier.

For careers, the career center is as helpful as you want them to be -- to get the most out of them you have to be smart and strategic about which events you go to and who you talk to. The clubs (Tech Club, Marketing Club, Consulting Club, etc.) are more helpful overall for careers, in particular the guidance from second year students. You will be prepared for your interviews if you put in the time and effort and sit down with enough second years.

Overall, it's a fantastic school. Getting an MBA isn't easy a top school like this, but the rewards are plentiful in all walks of life.

Northwestern,GMAT Club,"Kellogg has been really great so far.

The student body is diverse and it is incredible to hear the stories of my classmates- they are so accomplished! One thing I would like to underline for future applicants is how large the class size is. This can be overwhelming at times, whether you are trying to sign up for social events or trying to get some focused career guidance. That being said, this is definitely offset by the huge network you have access to and the number of people you are able to meet.

I received my offer late in the year and at that time it seemed like all they cared about was that I had a job not that it was the right job for me. I was underwhelmed but some of the professors.

Northwestern,GMAT Club,"Kellogg has done a great job meeting and exceeding my expectations. Kellogg is providing far more than just a stamp on my resume. All of the classes I've taken thus far have been engaging and I've picked up skills that I will be able to apply on day one of my internship/job as well as skills, such as Organizational Behavior, that will prove invaluable to me throughout my career.

The career center has been useful for teaching the basics about recruiting/interviewing, but as at any top program, the most helpful source of information comes from 2nd year students and alumni, who have been incredibly supportive of me thus far. My first year counterparts are also remarkably driven and intelligent, which can be quite intimidating until you realize how friendly and collaborative they all are.

My only complaint is that the classes might be too much work, which has thus far diluted my efforts to really focus on my career and networking, although I'm sure this will all even out after I get my internship in the spring.

We lost 2 all-star professors this year to other schools, but the caliber of all the professors with whom I have taken classes thus far have been quite high, so I have no complaints.

Northwestern,GMAT Club,"I truly believe that the quality of education is pretty comparable at any of the top schools. Given that, I chose Kellogg over other schools due to its collaborative atmosphere, student leadership opportunities, and collegial nature. I'm happy to say that I wasn't wrong about any of these. Even in recruiting, when two of us were going for the same positions at the same office locations, we helped each other, connecting each other with recruiters we might have missed or people we weren't able to network with. And when it came to student leadership, it was unparalleled. The amount of responsibility and leverage you have as a club leader, a student government leader, an event leader, or any other position is truly insane. My only complaint about that is that at times I wish the administration and other Kellogg staff helped the student leaders more and were more proactive instead of reactive (waiting for students to ask them to do something) — it was sometimes like having a full-time job in addition to your studies. If you're an extrovert, Kellogg is for you. Especially the social scene. If you're in introvert, it'll be tougher; I won't lie. But it can still be a very enjoyable experience, especially when people are friendly and willing to help.

Also, Kellogg LOVES diversity, including people from non-business/non-traditional career backgrounds. However, if you are one of these people, you will probably have a little more trouble in your classes and in recruiting. It's frustrating, especially, in recruiting because companies will be very interested in talking to you (because you're not the 15th ex-consultant they've met) but they'll test you harder in interviews and often choose a candidate with a more traditional background over you, all things being relatively equal. This is probably true of any business school you go to, though.

There's a ton of group work. And although this isn't everyone's cup of tea, I think it's an important skill to have. You're going to have to deal with it when you go back into your career — this lets you improve your leadership skills, your coping mechanisms, and your communication.

If you're going for a traditional avenue — consulting, CPG marketing, finance — Kellogg is very supportive, both from the student club side and the career office side. If you're going for something less traditional — media, sports, start-ups, net impact — it's going to be a little tougher. I know Kellogg continues making strides to help these non-traditional folks, but you will have to do a lot of your own legwork.",,,,truly quality education pretty comparable given chose due team atmosphere leadership job collegial nature happy wasnt wrong job u position office location helped connecting recruiter might missed werent network came leadership unparalleled amount responsibility leverage activity leader government leader activity leader position truly insane complaint time wish administration staff helped leader proactive instead reactive waiting ask sometimes fulltime job addition learn extrovert network scene introvert itll tougher wont lie enjoyable experience friendly love diverse including nonbusinessnontraditional job background probably trouble class job frustrating job job talking 15th exconsultant theyve theyll test harder job often choose candidate traditional background relatively equal probably true though there team work although isnt everyones cup tea important skill deal back job let improve leadership skill coping mechanism communication traditional avenue consulting cpg marketing finance support activity side job office side less traditional medium entrepreneurship net impact tougher continues making stride nontraditional folk legwork,-1

Even when class material is ""simple"", classmates have consistently elevated the level of learning.

2. Alumni support - alumni are just a phone call away. I don't know if it's the norm at all business schools, but my peers and I are never turned down when we call for help or information.

* Great school culture. Multiple Kellogg school events per week and lots of school spirit. Very diverse groups of people, and everyone will find a place to fit in. Definitely the most fun business school in the M7. When we have Kellogg versus Booth school events, literally 4 times Kellogg students attend than Booth students.

* Have made countless close friends who I expect to still be close to a decade from now.

* Location is great. 30 minutes away from the city, so people tend to hang out with each other and develop strong bonds...but city is close enough that if you get bored it's easy to uber/train out there for cheap.

Great assortment of classes. If you go to a smaller school, you might miss some cool electives. For example, I'm interested in strategy and healthcare, and there's a ton of options.

Stanford,GMAT Club,"This place is better than I expected...

Honestly, in trying to be incredibly critical, I have very little negative to share, and absolutely 0 substantial negatives to share. The professors, classmates, and facilities are incredible. I catch myself often in disbelief about what a diverse place this is, both in terms of the people here and the opportunities available.

To get more specific: there are classes on topics that are not only cutting edge, but often pushing the edge, especially in terms of leadership development and entrepreneurship. I often find myself having to choose between a great way to spend my time and an incredible way to spend my time.

A few examples: the GSB impact fund gives students a chance to invest real money in companies all the while learning what it takes to conduct due diligence on a company/building portfolio companies.

Another example of the network: since I have been here (just over 3 months), there have been numerous opportunities to work with alumni on interesting projects in new fields, where they would welcome fresh perspectives and encourage students using it as an opportunity to learn. I specifically got set up so I have a project this December in HI on a topic I am interested in but have no formal background in. Of course I am going to work my tail off, but the point is the network helped me find the opportunity.

There are many more examples, but most importantly I have come to realize how beautiful of a time this is to explore what are the things one wants to spend your life doing, and how to use business to help you do that (and hopefully help you help others to do the same).

**Finally, I want to make note that I am willing to help others by reviewing their essays. The ""What matters to you most and why"" question is something talked about a lot here, and I may be able to help you frame it so your message is clear. Reach out if interested and we can talk.**

UChicago,GMAT Club,"Booth is a fantastic school for those who have a very clear sense of what they want to do. Between the flexible curriculum, ability to take classes in both the Harper and Gleacher center, and the strengths in a wide variety of subjects, the school is a great place for independent people and those who are naturally outgoing. However the school's strengths are also its drawbacks, namely there is not a very strong cohort system, and so one has to really go the extra mile to get to know ones classmates.

As somebody who was transitioning sectors within finance, I found that the classes and brand helped immensely. I was able to secure a private equity internship without any prior banking experience.

Advice I would give to future applicants: you should seriously consider Booth, it's a fantastic school and the ""where fun goes to die"" adage does not apply to the business school, only the undergraduate college.",,,,clear sense flexible class ability class harper gleacher center strength wide variety class location independent naturally outgoing strength drawback namely strong community system extra mile classmate somebody transitioning sector within finance found class brand helped immensely secure private equity job without prior finance experience advice future seriously consider fun die adage apply undergraduate college,0
UChicago,GMAT Club,"Booth is a ""create your own adventure"" type business school. There's no cohort structure, and there's tons of freedom when choosing classes. This school is great for those who thrive with this unstructured academic and social approach.

The school gets all the basics right. Career services are good, and classes by and large are good. Banking, consulting, investment management and all the basic career paths are strong here. We also have private equity/venture capital too but it's a little harder to break into.

The one area which was disappointing, and why I could not give it a perfect rating, is the culture of the school. The culture isn't bad, but I do not believe it is as advertised. The school markets itself as a very intellectual, rigorous place. In my experience, there was a lot of platitudes and I never heard anything really interesting or thought-provoking. To the extent this culture exists, it's in the PhD program and academics, Booth's true strength area. The MBA program culture was pretty typical yuppie as far as I could tell.

Booth seems to have a strong presence in analytics, so if that's an area of interest the school is definitely worth checking out.

A lot of people end up having to do a ""specialized search"", meaning going for companies that do not recruit on campus. If you're looking for traditional big MBA employers like banking, consulting and tech, on-campus is fine. But most corporations, even some very large ones in the Chicagoland area, do not recruit at Booth directly.

UChicago,GMAT Club,"Every (successful) Booth applicant has likely heard about Booth's flexible curriculum, yet I can't stress enough how this ""we'll treat you like an adult and let you make your own choices"" philosophy can shape one's Booth experience.

I saw many classmates similarly take full advantage of the ability to pick and choose from a diverse course offerings to pursue their varied passion. This is not to say that academic is the dominant factor underlying a Booth experience; like other top MBA programs, we spent large chunks of our time exploring career options, preparing for and going through interviews, traveling, and of course, partying.

I was fortunate to meet and become good friends with ""Boothies"" in my class as well as the classes immediately above and immediately below mine, many of which came from a wide variety of fascinating backgrounds.

UChicago,GMAT Club,"Depending on the area of focus/industry you are interested in, the school offers different sets of resources. For example, if you are interested in investment banking or consulting, there is a wealth of resources (current students, alumni, clubs) that are available to help pursue an internship or job in these areas. However, if you are interested in some of the less common professions like marketing or PE, then much more of the onus is put on you to guide your search. Booth still makes great efforts to help in these areas but it still lacks in comparison to others.

I would suggest coming into business school with a purpose and an idea of what industry/profession you want to pursue. Although the school does a great job of providing background in most areas, do your homework before coming in to get the most out of the resources provided.

UChicago,GMAT Club,"Chicago Booth was extremely helpful for my career and the program fully met my expectations.

The student culture at Booth is amazing and students are very collaborative. Paying-it-forward is an important part of the mentality and students go to great lengths to help their classmates. Many students take leadership roles in student groups and help organize activities outside of school.

The academic experience is of highest quality and the flexible curriculum allows students to tailor the experience to their needs. Booth offers the option to take classes with world-class faculty but also offers opportunities for experiential learning in lab classes and internships. Students get flexibility and can choose between classes at the University of Chicago campus or at Booth's downtown Chicago facility.

Career services is highly professional and well-connected to industry. Firms recruit on-campus at modern interview facilities. All the major firms from key MBA industries (Consulting, Investment Banking, Tech) recruit talent from Chicago Booth.

I would suggest to future applicants to definitely go to Booth, specifically if you're interested in quant or math coursework. I chose to come here because I wanted to learn the hardest material if I was going to take 2 years off of work. Grade nondisclosure helps with this, and the open curriculum allows you to take whatever. Based on my internship nd conversations, it sounds like the opportunities are the same everywhere in the top 7, but Booth's real differentiator is the rigor of classes and the openness of coursework.

Professors are so hit or miss, especially in required courses. Also, 2/3 of the classes may be horse fudge (any class about leadership, any class about managerial decision making, etc).

UChicago,GMAT Club,"I'm a first year Booth MBA student (full-time) and I will focus this brief review on the things I was surprised by the most.

1. Pay it forward culture
As a first year, the amount of support you receive from second years is astounding. For example, if you're recruiting for consulting, second years are not only willing to help you prepare, but they will actively engage you - you don't even really need to seek them out. This ""pay it forward"" mentality extends to other aspects, and it's very evident it continues when you become an alumnus. I'm looking forward to giving back by helping out first years and future students when I'm an alum.

2. Professors
Ok, so maybe it's because I had a poor undergraduate experience, but I'm blown away by some of the professors. No, basic accounting has not been revolutionized at Booth, but some/many courses have professors who are amazing presenters and who deliver cutting edge courses because they're at the top of their respective fields.

3. Career services/recruitment
I didn't expect recruitment opportunities to be so organized.

UChicago,GMAT Club,"Booth is a pretty incredible place, but it is a unique environment that is best suited for those who are comfortable dealing with ambiguity and driven by intellectual curiosity.

The biggest factors that made me decide to attend Booth were:

(1) The flexible curriculum: I didn't appreciate this as much until I actually got into the program; it is incredible to choose what courses to take, what professors to have, and even what days of the week you want class.
(2) Student culture: If I had to sum it up, it would be the ""pay-it-forward culture"" -- 2Ys help 1Ys more than any program I have heard of. They help with everything from selecting classes to helping with interview prep. Since you take classes together (see #1), you build deeper relationships between classes.
(3) ""Challenge everything"": this is a motto of the school and it resonates within the classroom -- if you aren't challenging someone's ideas, then you're doing them a tremendous disservice.
(4) Chicago is an awesome city: the main campus is down in Hyde Park, but 80%+ students live in downtown Chicago (the 'Loop') closer to the Gleacher Center (Chicago Booth downtown campus). It would be better if the main campus was right down town, but by everyone coming together in HP, it creates a pretty cool student experience.
(5) Brand / rankings (if I am being honest).

Even with all these high expectations, the full-time experience exceeded them in almost every capacity. The support that you receive -- from the school, from second-years, and from your classmates is incredible. They never ""get you a job"" or ""tell you what classes to take"", but they're there to answer questions every step along the way.

If there was one thing I would recommend future applicants to do -- it'd be to figure out what makes Chicago Booth unique, and really ask yourself whether or not it's a good fit for you. A lot of people simply apply to the ""top 5"" schools, but the differences in culture, curriculum, and ""focus"" (whether it is social, academic, professional, etc.) can be stark. Do the ""soul searching"" before / while you apply to schools... not after you've made the decision.

Career placement is second to none -- every major company (consulting, IB, IM, and tech) recruits on campus. If anything, I think Booth's technology placement and entrepreneurship programs are underrated to its peers.",,,,pretty location unique community suited comfortable dealing ambiguity driven intellectual curiosity biggest factor decide attend 1 flexible class didnt actually got choose class professor day week class 2 culture sum payitforward culture 2ys 1ys heard everything selecting class helping job prep since class team see 1 build deeper relationship class 3 challenge everything motto resonates within classroom arent hard someone idea tremendous disservice 4 location main location hyde park 80 live downtown loop closer gleacher center downtown location better main location right location everyone coming team hp creates pretty cool experience 5 brand ranking honest high fulltime experience exceeded almost capacity support receive secondyears classmate never job tell class theyre answer question step along recommend future itd figure unique ask whether fit apply 5 difference culture class whether network class professional stark soul searching apply youve decision job placement none major job consulting ib tech job location tech placement entrepreneurship underrated classmate,1
UChicago,GMAT Club,"For me Bschool is about taking two years to do what you normally wouldn't, socialize with people you would never even think to say hello to, or try a new working environment. I will readily say that Booth was not the school that felt like home to me. However, I did like the intellectual energy I felt in Harper Center, the advice I'd received from alums, and the positive endorsements about career services.

One of the questions that I am often asked about Booth from prospective students and recent admits is, ""If there are no cohorts and students live all over Chicago does Booth really have much of a community?"" I've also repeatedly read comments like, ""the flexible curriculum does not allow for bonding,"" and ""Booth is a commuter school."" So does Chicago Booth have much of a community? I think that there are two main ways to define a school's community: tight-knit and engaged. I will say upfront that Booth does not have a tight-knit community. However, I would argue that neither do schools like Kellogg and Wharton (both of which are known for having strong communities). When people say a school's students are tight-knit they often are saying that everybody knows one another. I'd argue that when any class has more than 400 students it's impossible for the students to be tight-knit by that definition. So then if a school isn't tight-knit by the above definition does that mean that it does not have a strong community? Of course not! The biggest misconception is that Booth students are dispersed all over Chicago. The fact is that over 80% of students live within a 2 mile strip of the downtown neighborhoods the Loop, South Loop, and Streeterville. Heck, over 60% of students live in three buildings that are often referred to as the dorms (Millenium Park Plaza, Columbus Plaza, MDA). Just because Booth students do not live in close proximity to the school does not mean that they don't live in close proximity to one another.

Now let me address the lack of cohorts. Technically, Booth does have cohorts. Cohorted learning is only in place for Booth's one required course, LEAD, which takes place during orientation and the first 4 weeks of the first quarter. After LEAD there are a few big cohort based activities like Golden Gargoyles and Leadership Challenge, but for the most part cohort activities are spearheaded by cohort members and the graduate business council (i.e. cohort trivia, cohort t-shirt day, etc.). Although students aren't required to be at these events there is always a very healthy turnout. I think this illustrates the beauty that is Booth. At it's core this place is an exercise in free markets. Everything is driven by students' choices and Booth students choose to be actively involved with the school. Even without the typical structures to build school loyalty and student body engagement, students are so tied to Booth we often struggle to excoriate ourselves from the ""Booth Bubble."" There is more activity going on at Booth than any person can keep track of and the majority of it is student run. Booth students choose to invest their time in making sure this community is thriving. There is an overflow of people clamoring to participate in admit weekend, career services, admissions, and more. Oftentimes these activities require hours of work and we still want to do it. I think this speaks volumes to the ties people have to Booth.

I will readily admit that although Booth has a very vibrant community it is built differently than at other schools. In allowing people to pick their classes, schedule, and professors it's very much so a choose your own adventure kind of place. Booth fosters breadth of socializing, but it's up to the individual to determine where to seek depth. One of the best consequences of this breadth is a greater sense of cohesion between the 1st & 2nd year classes. This is the very opposite of the structure at most schools where the depth of socializing is built into the program and it's up to students to seek out a wider breadth. Truth be told the breadth was difficult for me at first. I felt that I was meeting a lot of people but not really forming deeper relationships. It wasn't until ski trip when I had a week of consistent socializing with people that I started really making friends. The opportunities to really bond with people are all over the place at Booth. However, it might take a little patience and being proactive to figure out what those opportunities are for you.

I will tell any prospective student how much I love being here, but I will also say that it isn't for everybody. If you really like structure and aren't looking to try something different then Booth isn't the school for you. If you tend not to be proactive in getting to know people then you probably shouldn't be here. However, if the bevvy of choice appeals to you or you want to try a social environment that is different from what you're used to then this might could be the place for you.",,,,bschool taking normally wouldnt socialize never hello try new working community readily felt home intellectual energy felt harper center advice id received alum positive endorsement job service question often asked prospective recent admits community live community repeatedly read comment flexible class allow bonding commuter community main define community tightknit engaged upfront tightknit community argue neither known strong community tightknit often saying everybody another id argue class 400 impossible tightknit definition isnt tightknit definition mean strong community class biggest misconception dispersed fact 80 live within 2 mile strip downtown neighborhood loop south loop streeterville heck 60 live three building often referred dorm millenium park plaza columbus plaza mda live close proximity mean live close proximity another let address lack community technically community cohorted learn location required class lead location orientation 4 week semster lead community based activity golden gargoyle leadership challenge community community activity spearheaded community member graduate council ie community trivia community tshirt day although arent required activity healthy turnout illustrates beauty core location exercise free market everything driven choice choose actively involved without typical structure build loyalty size engagement tied often struggle excoriate bubble activity keep track majority run choose invest time making sure community thriving overflow clamoring participate admit weekend job service admission oftentimes activity require hour work speaks volume tie readily admit although vibrant community built differently allowing pick class schedule professor choose adventure kind location foster breadth socializing individual determine seek depth consequence breadth greater sense cohesion 1st 2nd class opposite structure depth socializing built seek wider breadth truth told breadth hard felt meeting forming deeper relationship wasnt ski trip week consistent socializing started making classmate job bond location might patience proactive figure job tell prospective love isnt everybody structure arent try isnt tend proactive getting probably shouldnt bevvy choice appeal try network community used might location,2
UChicago,GMAT Club,"I had an amazing experience at Booth. The program and culture live up to the mantras of ""Challenge everything"" and ""Independent thought"" in my experience. Personally, I was drawn to the fact that there is no one path at Booth -- you're not forced into a cohort, you're not told which classes you have to take, you're not assigned to study teams and instead, you have the freedom to chart your own course (within some guidelines of course!) and you gain much wider exposure (e.g., taking classes with 2nd years). Looking back, the LEAD course was extremely helpful and I apply those lessons about leadership and self-awareness everyday now. The student culture is very strong (and different than what many perceive) -- it's a bit different from other schools where there's a concentrated campus that everyone lives near and again, things aren't dictated for you. I was incredibly impressed by my classmates -- not just their intelligence and career drive but also their passion for traveling and experiencing the city of Chicago.

UChicago,Niche,"All the basic elements of a business school were fantastic. This includes the classes, the career center, the facilities, the location, and the plethora of activities (career & fun) available at the school. If you go here, you won't be disappointed with any of the essentials. MBA students mostly go to school to get a job, and Booth does not disappoint. I will point out, however, location matters a little bit here. If you want to live in Chicago Booth is great. If not somewhere else may be slightly easier.

Why only four out of five stars? Well, the student life wasn't always perfect. There's no cohort system like other schools so its easy to get overwhelmed by the mass of people. Having grown up in Chicago, it was honestly easier to go back to the friends I had before than sort through 600 folks.

UChicago,Niche,"The academic environment at the University of Chicago is undoubtedly excellent. Although I haven’t officially started classes yet, various departments and institutions have already sent numerous emails inviting me to participate in informal academic activities. My peers are also very enthusiastic about academics, with several already preparing to host seminars or smaller-scale academic discussions — and as I just said, classes haven’t even officially started yet!

However, safety is a downside to the school. During my first week in Chicago, the sounds of police sirens outside my window never truly stopped.

MIT,GMAT Club,"As a first year, I have been surprised by the sheer amount of resources and opportunities that are available to all students, such as the incredible entrepreneurial ecosystem. If you are interested in something, there will be a way for you to do it - whether it's starting your own FinTech startup through FinTech Ventures, completing an internship with a company through PM Lab, or even taking a coding class within the MIT engineering community.
Please share about the school, career services, and student life. My favorite part of the program has to be the students and my classmates - people have such diverse backgrounds and interests and are incredibly collaborate and supportive of each other, whether it's your core team doing accounting homework together, or prepping for a case interview, people are always willing to help. When I was applying for my MBA, I wanted to be part of a program that was on the smaller side and where I could become close to my cohort. With ~400 students per year, it's been a great experience always having the opportunity to meet new people, but still know a large majority of people in the class.

The professors are incredibly well-respected and leaders in their field. It's inspiring to take classes with them and become close with them, which is very common at Sloan. In addition, there are a wide selection of courses within Sloan (and across MIT and Harvard, where you are welcome to take classes as well!). Even though Sloan is not officially a ""non-grade-disclosure"" program, it's very hard to get lower than a B if you put in some effort into the class. However, I find that the emphasis on in-person classes/lack of flexibility for students missing classes for recruiting to be a surprise and an area for improvement.

MIT,GMAT Club,"MIT Sloan has been an exceptional experience and exceeded my expectations in supporting my career change from Military to Consulting.

I initially dismissed MIT in my MBA applications as too ""technical."" However, as I spoke to more people, applied, and have spent the past year here I feel that MIT excels in all technical and analytics topics while not compromising on traditional management education.

Career/Recruiting
My goal entering MIT was to enter consulting in the short term and prepare for international management in Asia. To that end, I took a broad curriculum in all management basics, with a specialization in business analytics through Sloan's new Analytics certificate. For results, Sloan's Asian Business Conference led me to intern at an outstanding Japanese company as their first ever MBA intern, and earn a full-time offer at a Management Consulting firm. I have found that the formula of my military (interpreted as high soft skills) combined with cutting-edge analytics training at MIT (about as technical as it gets in business) generates immediate interest from most executives with whom I have interviewed.

Culture:
Hands-down, Sloan has the top 2-3 cultures among all MBA programs. Students and alumni are high-quality, close-knit, ultra-supportive, and excited about Sloan. When connecting with alumni in firms or industries of interest, I have close to a 100% response rate. Culture is definitely more casual at Sloan compared to other top programs; it's very much a t-shirt/button-down results-over-appearance culture.

About professors, classes and curriculum
Strengths:
1) Access to the ENTIRE MIT ecosystem for classes.
2) Anything Analytics, Artificial Intelligence, Data Science related.
3) System Dynamics (it was invented here)
4) Operations: Logistics, Supply Chain, etc...

Management staples: Finance, Accounting, Marketing etc..are universally high quality but I wouldn't say that they are ground-breaking or a special strength.

Weaknesses:
Leadership: Limited curriculum and less focus on the students future role as leaders of large companies. In general, Sloan seems not to be viewed as a general management program.

Outstanding placement in consulting and tech. Most people (80%+) that wanted a consulting offer seemed to get at least one of their top 5 firms. That being said, MBB is still very tough here and I estimate no more than 40% of people who recruited for consulting got an MBB offer.

Tech: Amazon is the strongest tech firm on campus (around 10-20 people headed there I believe). To some degree Google (around 5 full-time offers I believe), while Facebook doesn't really come up very often. Tesla has also recently started recruiting here and will take some full-time folks.

Entrepreneurship: If you want to do a start-up or join one, the sky's the limit here. Extremely strong alumni network into startups and the Martin Trust Center for Entrepreneurship with Bill Aulet is an outstanding starting point for getting into startups.

Finance: Full Disclosure: Didn't participate in finance recruiting myself. Some of the main banks come here but finance is less popular at Sloan as a rule. For some people, this is an advantage as there is less competition for slots but there are also a few top banks that don't come here because of the smaller student body and reduced level of interest. Still, academically, there is a strong history of finance learning at Sloan and my finance oriented classmates are very satisfied with their learning.",,,,exceptional experience exceeded supporting job change military consulting initially dismissed application technical spoke applied spent past excels technical analytics topic compromising traditional management education careerrecruiting goal entering enter consulting short semester prepare international management asia end broad class management basic specialization analytics sloans new analytics certificate result sloans asian conference led intern outstanding japanese job ever intern earn fulltime job management consulting job found formula military interpreted high soft skill combined cuttingedge analytics training technical generates immediate interest executive interviewed culture handsdown 23 culture among network highquality closeknit ultrasupportive excited connecting network job industry interest close 100 response rate culture casual compared tshirtbuttondown resultsoverappearance culture professor class class strength 1 access entire ecosystem class 2 analytics artificial intelligence data science related 3 system dynamic invented 4 operation logistics supply chain management staple finance accounting marketing etcare universally high quality wouldnt groundbreaking special strength weakness leadership limited class less future role leader large job general seems viewed general management outstanding placement consulting tech 80 wanted consulting job seemed least 5 job said mbb hard estimate 40 recruited consulting got mbb job tech amazon strongest tech job location around 1020 headed degree google around 5 fulltime job facebook doesnt often tesla recently started job fulltime folk entrepreneurship entrepreneurship join sky limit strong network entrepreneurship martin trust center entrepreneurship bill aulet outstanding starting point getting entrepreneurship finance full disclosure didnt participate finance job main finance finance less popular rule advantage less competition slot finance smaller size reduced level interest academically strong history finance learn finance oriented classmate satisfied learn,2

Sloan is the target school for all major consulting firms and investment banks. The competition for IBD jobs is significantly less intense than peer schools as there are less applicants.

MIT,GMAT Club,"MIT Sloan is the business school for people who have hesitations about joining an environment of Type A, hyper-competitive students -- something business schools have unfortunately become known for. This is supported by three driving forces:

1) Admissions intentionally selects to create a down-to-earth culture
2) No strong requirement (but introspection still required!) to know your career path post-MBA
3) Sloan is always humbled by the engineering presence in the entire context of MIT

Starting with the culture, the famous Rod Garcia, who has led the MIT Sloan admissions team for longer than almost any other business school, is known and highly respected for his ability to pick the right candidates to fill the seats at MIT Sloan. The result is a cohort of humble (instead of proud), collaborative (instead of competitive) and accomplished (although you wouldn't know it if you met them at a party) students. This means, despite lack of non-grade disclosure, the cohort is more than willing to share with everyone else, maximizing learning and development opportunities for everyone. The cohort is encouraged to be proud of being the best ""team"" material, based on the thesis that teams, not individuals, are what drive business and action in the real world.

In an environment that does not start with a facetious post MBA goal, everyone is encouraged to take risks, with no baggage or excuses, further contributing to the shared struggle and culture described above.

In a way, this culture is necessary, in an environment such as MIT that is so dominated by the engineering schools, who will always remain skeptical of the business school students. The culture goes a long way in connecting these faculties, and can claim to have one of most well integrated entrepreneurship centers, reaching across Sloan and engineering rather than in individual silos.

However, this culture does not come without its opportunity costs. While the focus is internal, and maximises the enrichment of the student cohort, it does not perform as strong at representing and boasting its advantages to the public. As a result, Sloan probably ranks 1-3 spots below where it belongs on most business school rankings, if that matters to you. But it doesn't seem to matter to the students who apply and are ultimately accepted into Sloan's collaborative culture.

The one-semester Core is a great common bonding experience for the whole class, and is brief enough to provide space for 3 semesters of electives. However, the challenge of staffing the core subjects with enough high quality lecturers diminishes the experience of Core subjects. This is in stark contrast to my experience with elective subjects, which have a very high quality. Part of this challenge could be mitigated by streaming students or allowing waivers from certain subjects -- for example, all students need to take economics, accounting or statistics even if they have majored in it.

MIT,GMAT Club,"Two things have made my experience at Sloan great: 1) the fantastic culture embodied by the student community and 2) the variety of interests and expertise available at MIT.

Students here take their learning seriously but don't take themselves too seriously. You will find that there are few if any ""hidden agendas"" when it comes to collaboration and group work. People are genuinely interested in your personal experiences and look to learn from their peers.

Additionally, there's a lot of cool stuff happening at MIT. I don't think this needs much explanation.

- Transition from tech consulting into product management
- Relocated to the west coast after business school
- Bridge gaps I had domain knowledge related to leadership, finance and marketing
- Improve on my domain knowledge related to technology

MIT is a great choice to transition into a more technical career post business school. As an MBA student at MIT, you can take up to 3 classes outside of MIT Sloan to broaden your skills - taking classes at the MIT Media Lab or Computer Science Department is common among students in the program.

MIT Sloan has about 20% of their alumni base in the Ba Area so it was easy to imagine leveraging the MIT alumni network out in the bay area post business school.

MIT Sloan has 1 required core semester with the remaining 3 semester free to fill your schedule with a broad range of electives to fill any gaps you may have or double down on any areas of interest.

MIT,GMAT Club,"What is special about MIT?
a. The spirit of MIT – the university has a soul, and for me that was the most amazing thing
b. Focus on entrepreneurship, being a hub of innovation and out-of-the-box thinking not only from the MBA classmates but also the brilliant minds from the engineering schools
c. No peer pressure to join stereotypical MBA jobs like consulting or ibanking, a lot of new ideas and pursuits are encouraged
d. Focus on team work
e. Tolerance for failure

As for the atmosphere in the school, there is a palpable sense of mutual respect and admiration amongst all students, no one is ranked or called out for either being from a wealthy background or having certain brands on their resume. The students love the way in which selection process happens and assume there must be something wonderful about everyone who is there. Sloan is not transactional. There is no fee for every mixer or interaction, a lot of things are school sponsored and encourage everyone to come out and get to know each other and do stuff together.

As for the area, Cambridge is a university town. Lots of brilliant young minds, the vibe is very young, entrepreneurial, energetic and optimistic. Accommodation is expensive but unaffordable. Boston/Cambridge has a nice cultural vibe. Lots of art events to attend, very pro-diversity and liberal. Winters are cold and snowed under but its not windy like Chicago so its quite beautiful if you ask me.

Who will enjoy the program?
Someone who is liberal, looking for a genuinely engaging experience versus just doing bschool as a resume check point. Someone with an inquisite mind and proactive nature and doesn’t expect to be spoon fed or handheld all the time. Folks with a passion for innovation, entrepreneurship and technology will do very well here. Those who need structures not so well.

Faculty is all about high thinking. Focus is on bringing out the essence of a concept, encourage open debate and discussion, provide a spectrum of perspectives. Assignments and learning are for the most part meaningful and relevant. If you don’t like a class, you can opt out late into the semester and it won’t reflect on your academic record which is just wonderful.


Saying you are from MIT or MIT Sloan opens almost every door. Its really upto how focused, proactive and determined you are
Career office is very good when it comes to consulting, finance, tech and increasingly marketing jobs. They organize a lot of workshops, coaching sessions etc. Very helpful.

Second, the student body is limited to about 280 in each class. It makes for a more intimate learning environment, and frankly everyone gets to know each other over the course of two years.

Dartmouth,GMAT Club,"Tuck knows it's strengths and plays to them extremely well. The career prospects for consulting are unmatched and the alumni network is extremely responsive and helpful when seeking employment.

Social life is made up of house parties, bars in town, and tons of events on campus. You'll get fatigue of activities before you ever get bored. Hanover is quaint and hospitable and a handful of new eateries (with surprisingly fantastic food) have popped up in the last two years. There is easy access to New York via a luxury bus-line (over-sized leather chairs, wi-fi, keurig, snacks, and drinks) and Boston is 2 hours away. Most students bring cars.

There is no doubt that I am better set up to succeed in my career after attending the Tuck School of Business.

Dartmouth,GMAT Club,"The entire student body is incredibly nice. It's hard to find a mean person at Tuck. However, the school does not attract as many diverse students as some of the other schools located in big cities. This is a bit of a disappointment. I will give Tuck credit though, as they are making significant efforts to fix this. The number of women enrolled at Tuck is up from 32% to 42%, which is a huge leap in just one year. I would like to see more diversity in terms of ethnic backgrounds and socioeconomic standing.

Herd mentality is a bit strong at Tuck. Almost everyone does hiking, hockey, skiing, and other winter sports because their friends are doing it.

The alumni of Tuck are amazing. They have been incredibly helpful to me during my job search. It's true that they are willing to drop everything to spend time talking to you. Of all the alumni that I have reached out to, everyone has gotten back to me promptly. The size of the alumni base is not that big, but they are MIGHTY.

Location - this is probably the hardest thing for me to adjust to and it will vary from person to person. I thought living in a small rural town would be fun, but I miss city life so much.

Dartmouth,GMAT Club,"Tuck has met all my expectations to date. First, it provides a wide range of opportunities not only limited to consulting or banking. There are a myriad of general management jobs and more recently technology jobs available. While there are lot of opportunities for the Northeast, increasingly there are opportunities further afield with a growing alumni base out on the West Coast. Overall, I found the Careers Development Office and the alumni network to be valuable resources in the job search.

Tuck is a close-knit program that really focuses on community. Since Dean Slaughter took over, there has been an increased focus on innovation and global experiences. I am very optimistic about the changes that Dean Slaughter will push forward and believe that Tuck will continue to improve its offer while keeping the thing that it is really good at - the close-knit residential full-time MBA program.

Due to the small class size, you really can get to know all your classmates. To date, I know every single person of my class and around 50-60% of the class above and below. There is something to be said for shared experiences and I think this is the primary reason why Tuck has such strong alumni support. Whenever I speak with an alum, we frequently talk about things happening at Tuck and age old traditions like tripod hockey or skiing at Killington.

Tuck is not for everyone due to its size and location but I personally viewed both as big advantages. I would recommend any applicant to take advantage of the open interview system to visit and interview on campus. You may be surprised!

The core curriculum is a key component of Tuck and I really like how it stitches together to form a cohesive experience. In particular, Professors Neslin and Kopalle, who both teach core statistics, are phenomenal professors.

Culture -- Culture felt more cerebral and scholarly than other business schools I've seen. The student body was pretty tight knit and collaborative. However, there was a huge emphasis placed on wealth, and friend groups tended to form across ""class"" lines.

Networking -- Hands down the greatest value add of HBS. Alumni have a very strong presence on and off campus, and HBS grads tend to stick together. Most people found jobs through the alumni network (including myself)

Value -- Great value for the money -- probably the best. Very generous financial aid package (need-based) and the brand/network benefits pay dividends long after graduation.

Harvard,GMAT Club,"HBS has provided everything I could possibly want in a business school.

The only complaint that I have about the program is that we don't have any weekly day off like many other programs do (Kellogg has Tuesdays off, Anderson gets Friday off). Honestly though, the fact that is my biggest complaint about the program shows how great the program is.

Coming from consulting, I heard a lot of opinions about various business schools.

- Case Method: nearly all classes here are case method where you read a case and debate what decisions should be made in class. And you often have the case protagonist in the room because HBS professors write most of the cases. By the time you graduate, you've made thousands of real world decisions and had to defend them to very smart people.

- Sections: HBS is a huge b-school with nearly 1000 students, but in your first year, you're put in a section of ~95 students.

Harvard,GMAT Club,"Business school is unfortunately not a 2 year vacation at HBS. Classes are challenging - you always have to be on top of your game because of class participation and cold calls - and the learning curve in the first semester is very steep. Class attendance is mandatory (HBS has a very strict attendance policy) and there is class 5 days a week. What that does is force everyone to be very engaged, leading to better discussions, and a lot more learning than if it were just the professor speaking. That being said, the case method is a little more difficult to enact in classes like finance and accounting, and it can be hard for those with non-finance backgrounds to get up to speed quickly because the school just throws you in the deep end with financial modeling.

HBS completely met my needs because I wanted to come to business school to learn something (and not be paying $75k/year just to network). It was academically a lot harder than I expected, but everyone is very nice and helpful - a lot of pre-HBS finance people do section reviews out of their desire to help their sectionmates.

Case method classes can be nerve-racking yet invigorating. The first year is very structured. You are told what classes to take and where to sit.

Harvard,GMAT Club,"Overall I got a lot out of attending HBS. The first year was really regimented which was a bit frustrating for me but second year was a lot of fun as I dove into subjects that I was passionate about. The faculty are world class and readily accessible to students, alumni answer your emails, and despite the reputation, most everyone is friendly and willing to help you out. I am friends with many HBSers to this very day and I still remember them taking the time to work with me on financial models or accounting principles outside of class when they could otherwise have been doing more fun things.

The biggest surprise for me was the sheer amount of work involved. Between case prep, study groups, and classes, HBS seems to have the heaviest academic workload of the top b-school programs despite the fact that it has a reputation of being filled with people only focused on networking (probably true for some but not most).

I went into HBS to either do a startup or try to transition into tech. I started a tech startup during school and leveraged their many resources available to entrepreneurs.

Harvard,GMAT Club,"I came to HBS to make a pivot in my career. Though I did make a pivot, it definitely wasn't the one I expected.

The plan was to go from being an engineer and product manager at a big tech company, to being a product marketer at a big tech company. I had a clear sense of who I was, what I wanted to do, and why I wanted to do it. I believe this is a large part of why I got accepted into HBS (and only HBS). Ultimately, I ended up founding my own tech startup instead. I never expected that to happen.

The HBS program challenged me in ways I didn't expect. It wasn't academically challenging, but personally challenging. I was pushed to try everything, to explore, and to learn more about myself in the process. It was that exploration that led to my ultimate career choice.

The student body still leans towards management, finance, and consulting, but academically you can't really specialize like you can at other schools. HBS teaches you just enough about every topic to be a competent manager, and nothing more. This is not the right experience for everyone.

Future applicants: have a story ready that described who you are, what you've done, and what you want to do. Incorporate different elements of that overarching narrative into components of your application.

Things at HBS might feel hokey or ""kumbaya"" at times. Don't become cynical. Embrace all the weird and oddball activities. Get everything you can out of every experience, even ones that you think are completely outside of your interests.

NYU,GMAT Club,"Now that I’m one year out and at the rosy shades of a 70% virtual experience (sarcasm) have waned, I figured it was time to write up a review.

I recruited for a number of industries, and found the school’s network, but perhaps more predominantly the location, to be invaluable. There are subsets of opportunities only found at NY schools by nature of being in the city. Recruiting for the common career paths is well structured and is ran in tandem with student clubs. I am currently on the buyside and found that the overall brand compares very favorably to peer schools (SOM, Tuck, etc.).

The faculty and teaching quality is second to none and probably the hidden gem of the program. There are the most Nobel laureates on faculty of any MBA program and the classes were phenomenal. You can cross list 15+ credits with other schools which was something I readily took advantage of. Of course, the overall value add that you get out of this may be minimal in the grand scheme of things, since MBAs are all about those superficial two-minute conversations. In all seriousness, I was able to make a few close friends, but definitely did miss out a bit because of a global pandemic.

So, in the end, great MBA.

NYU,GMAT Club,"NYU Stern really focuses on recruiting for IQ and EQ (emotional intelligence), and it shows in the student body. I have had the opportunity to meet so many wonderful and smart people, and the network you make from this program is very worthwhile. The course and professors are interesting to - in the night classes you will often find professors who are experts in their field and currently working. The founder of Buzzfeed occasionally teaches a night class. The recrutiting options for off-campus jobs are great as well because of the location in NYC. Any company you could possibly want to network with is just a subway ride away. I have seen other students from schools in Boston at recruiting events, and they travel down to NYC Thursday night and have to get a hotel for the weekend to do the same thing that I can do leaving my apartment in the morning.

The recruiting process is solid and great companies do come to campus, but it can be a little difficult to get top jobs if you don't have a great background coming into the program. There are plenty of kids with awesome GMAT scores and great grades who didn't even get an interview for MBB. That's not to stay it's not possible to get top consulting jobs, but they don't take many people from Stern (at least for internships). IB is a different story - plenty of people get internships at top banks. Some people who recruit for banking get no banking offers, but the majority get something, and every bank you could possibly want to work for recruits in decent numbers at Stern. It's also a good place to go if you want to work at Amazon - we send a bunch of people there every year.

NYU,GMAT Club,"NYU Stern excels in attracting a diverse and talented student body and the location (B-School in SoHo) probably cannot be beat by any other institution. Formally an investment banking feeder, the school has been expanding its reach into the Strategy/Management Consulting, Tech and Luxury Retail fields post financial downturn with incremental success. Every year, things get a little bit better on this front. More student go for these jobs, more get hired, and so on. That being said, if you're interested in Investment Banking or other sell-side jobs, it's a great place to go to business school.

While the student body is in my opinion its biggest asset, the school is still figuring out how to balance bringing in more diversity with the more mundane institutional goals of running a business school (making sure student GMAT scores and post-graduation salaries remain competitive enough to generate a high USNews Ranking). What I mean by this is, someone joining the school who was formerly a photographer, that then goes and works for an economic development non-profit after graduation, probably won't help those raw numbers (lower GMAT, lower salary), but will add tremendous value to the NYU community and should be admitted to the school.

NYU,GMAT Club,"The community itself is extremely diverse with a substantial portion of the students coming from international locations. The clubs are all student run and we get a lot of opportunity to interact with the other students as well as admin and faculty.
There’s a strong sense of paying it forward and MBA2’s go out of their way to help MBA1’s with recruiting and everything else. There’s almost always a wait list for volunteering opportunities to help incoming students, new admits and MBA1’s. I personally benefited immensely thanks to the MBA2’s being involved heavily in college activities.

One of the biggest advantages is being in the heart of NYC which gives students unparalleled access to all major firms, prominent guest lecturers that Stern brings in weekly, a plethora of projects and mentors.

The faculty is outstanding with particularly strong marketing and finance departments. Strategy professors all work on the cutting edge in real world projects and therefore bring the latest learning’s from the field to the class.
Experiential learning programs like the Stern Consulting Corps give students a chance to apply classroom theory to real world scenarios while being mentored by a Stern professor. Because all the clients are local (companies in NYC) you get more face time and therefore more chance to interact with your clients.
The Stern Signature Projects are unique in that you will be solving really unstructured problems for some high impact clients (usually with a social focus).
While the experience on both of these depends on the kind of team you have, as long as you are easy to work with and flexible you will have a really good experience on both of these.

Stern has traditionally been strong in finance but now does really well in consulting and marketing recruiting as well.
Recruiting will be a big part of your life when you start at business school. While Stern’s location helps it immensely, I feel that the banking recruiting is more structured than the consulting recruiting. MBB don’t consider Stern a core school and take a total of about 20 people combined. Higher ranked schools definitely send more students to these firms.
That being said, the Stern community (students and the career development team) are great resources to prepare for jobs. Programming starts almost immediately and by the time interview season starts you are more or less prepared for all interviews. Recruiting is definitely hard work and from my experience the people who work the hardest are definitely rewarded with great offers. Everyone ends up with an offer for the summer, but it may not be their top choice of firm.

The exposure you will get in terms of companies is unparalleled. I was able to attend numerous events hosted by companies in the city and work my way through the networking to land interviews with most of the top consulting firms.

NYU,GMAT Club,"NYU really does take advantage of its location in downtown New York City. The clubs do an amazing job organizing corporate visits. Job interviews are often just a walk or subway ride from campus and plenty of companies come to campus for information sessions and recruiting.

There is a good breadth and depth of courses offered, although some are only offered in the evenings. Students have been petitioning for more day sections.

There are multiple ""superstar"" professors and they are generally worth seeking out if they teach in your area of interest. I would say that the quality of teacher (and to a lesser extent, classmates) had more influence on the value of the course than the material and its applicability to my career.

NYU,GMAT Club,"I believe one of the most important things in Business School is recruiting - whether you'd like to admit it or not, most students come to business school to find a better job when they graduate.

I was an unorthodox student at Stern. I wasn't interested in Banking and thought I would give consulting a shot (yes - Stern is pretty good for the future consulting). However, I realized quickly that I'm not interested in consulting either. After a trip to the Silicon Valley, I figured that that's the place for me.

However, being in New York, it wasn't easy to make this transition. Unfortunately, I believe that my recruiting process was successful because of me, and despite our career services. I'm afraid that most associates at that office are not familiar enough with what we call off-campus recruiting, and that was biggest challenge during my time at Stern.

After learning things the hard way in my first year, I managed to land an awesome job at one of the big tech companies in the Bay Area.

NYU,GMAT Club,"I had my doubts about the quality of education and the student body before accepting. However, after spending 5 months (2 semesters -Fall and Winter Intensive), I feel NYU-Stern is by far one of the best part time programs out there.

Pros -
- Student body diversity. This helps in class since you get to learn from everyone's experience, sometimes more than the professor.
- Location, Location, Location!!
- Faculty
- Resources

Cons -
- Curriculum is quite intensive, but maybe this is a pro
- I can't think of anymore cons but maybe the full time ranking can be improved a little more.

I know one of my classmate got admitted to Yale executive program and after a campus visit decided NYU was better. Another got admitted to Chicago booth executive program and after spending a semester, decided NYU was better. I can't compare the quality of Langone program to any other top business schools since I haven't had any first hand experience, but so far my experience has been excellent.

This is an intensive program and you will be tired with the work load. Be mentally prepared to put in the hard work! Secondly, make use of the location. We have people all the way from Miami and Michigan attending weekend classes. However, if you have the option, try to move within Manhattan so you can make use of the network and social events. There's plenty going on at campus!

Columbia,GMAT Club,"I went to Columbia to get hired at an MBB consulting firm, and that's ultimately what happened, so I can certainly say the school met my expectations and goals. A few random thoughts about the school from a recent graduate:

One thing I didn't appreciate about CBS is since the school is located literally in Manhattan, it's much more difficult (and orders of magnitude more expensive) to construct new buildings, so this issue ultimately gets a pass from me.

Kellogg and Fuqua seem to have a lock on the community rep, but I think that CBS should be included in that conversation. Even with the myriad distractions in NYC (more on that below), CBS students have an incredibly strong connection to each other and the school. If I wanted to fill up every night of the week with club and social events purely with CBSers, it'd be very easy to do. The generally held viewpoint that CBS is internally extremely competitive and cutthroat is completely false.

This is something that I've always emphasized to prospective students: more than anything, CBS is about choice. Between academics, clubs, social events, networking, coffee chats, internships (in school and summer), mentoring, and the general distractions of NYC, there's always something to pull you in a different direction. Some of my classmates held essentially full-time jobs in Connecticut, others had three kids in Long Island, and others could always be counted on to be in Watson (the library) when not in class. Some were club kids who were constantly jet-setting, and others were at every single on campus event. The really nice aspect of this is that you could be part of one of these groups one week and another the next - the fluidity and frequency of events were strengths. After the core curriculum, academics is literally a choose-your-own-adventure, with no majors or departmental requirements to fulfill. A caveat here: if you're the type of person who needs more hand-holding and structure to your MBA experience, you may feel more lost at CBS. Those with a strong sense of self-direction and motivation tend to be more successful.

Of the big three placements (consulting, finance, tech), CBS excels in two of them and performs reasonably well in tech - all the big firms are on campus and seems like half my friends are going to Amazon. If you're not going into one of the bigger industries, your career search will have to be much more self-driven.

From a consulting perspective, CBS is amazing. I'm speaking from a biased perspective, as I was on the board of the Management Consulting Association and gave 100+ cases to first years, but the MCA is well-recognized as one of the best MBA consulting clubs for a reason. I was exposed to easily over a dozen top consulting firms with minimal effort on my own part, and formed solid relationships with recruiters and alumni at virtually all of them.

People recruiting for other, less standard, career paths also had a more difficult time than they might have expected.

Academic experiences can vary greatly by class. I had a couple that I thought were a little useful but most were a waste of time. Overall, I think CBS does a good job of teaching the basics of accounting and corporate finance but don't expect to get much more than that.

CBS is good if you want to go to B school in NY and stay in the city after. Two years after graduation, most of my friends are still in the city.

Columbia,GMAT Club,"Columbia Business School has a great MBA program if you want to either (i) leverage your career in finance, especially portfolio management; or (ii) want to land a job in NYC, in several industries, ranging from consulting to investment banking to start-ups.
It may seem a little bit cliche, but the school does a tremendous job to create a network of professionals in NYC. Also, being in NYC makes it super easy for speakers to go to class. And since most of the professors are not just academic professors but also practitioners, the content of classes are very up to date of what is in the marketplace.
On the negative side, I can mention the lack of classes in other areas other than finance, especially leadership. In later years the dean is increasing the focus on this particular area, but my feeling is that it is behind other schools such as HBS, Wharton, etc.",,,,either leverage job finance portfolio management ii land job several industry ranging consulting investment finance entrepreneurship may seem bit cliche tremendous job create network professional super easy speaker class since professor class professor practitioner content class date marketplace negative side mention lack class location finance leadership later dean increasing particular location feeling behind,0
Columbia,GMAT Club,"Anyone that is considering Columbia is also likely considering a bunch of great schools that have many of the same positives; namely access to a great network, excellent professors, smart classmates, professional opportunities, and (everyone's favorite) Grade Non-Disclosure. From what I can tell there are 2 things that make Columbia stand out: New York City and finance classes/opportunities. I chose Columbia because it was a top 10 school (I didn't think anything less was really worth the investment) and I wanted to live in NY (mainly for personal reasons).

However, after going I can say that I think there are a few other things that make Columbia awesome:
- A surprising level of community, especially for a ""city school."" Orientation is definitely weighted towards the community side of things with a dash of academic and professional things scattered throughout, I think this is to make sure we have that community despite nobody really living on campus (not a lot of on campus housing, usually only goes to international students and a small set of west coasters). Throughout the year there are weekly happy hours on campus that are typically preceded by CBS Matters where 1-2 people from your cluster (~70 students you have all your core classes with) present about their life and what is important to them. CBS Matters is definitely my favorite thing about Columbia. In addition to on campus happy hour on Thursdays there is Rugby Happy Hour on Wednesdays at a bar a few subway stops away. It is open to the whole school, not just the rugby team (although I would highly recommend joining the rugby team because it's awesome), and usually has equal or better attendance than school-sponsored happy hour.
- A ton of travelling. This is something I haven't done as much as many of my classmates, mainly because it can get really expensive/often eats into time I could be spending with my husband. However, there are TONS of opportunities to travel. In the summer before school starts a huge chunk of the school takes part in the ""pre-MBA World Tour"" which includes student-organized trips pretty much all over the world (I got to take part in the final leg in the Hamptons with about 200 classmates). Then over fall break every cluster organizes a trip, we went to the Dominican Republic (one of my clustermates is from there so he planned most of it) and during winter and spring break the school offers “Global Immersion” classes and study tours to a ton of different places (Israel, Japan, South Korea, India, and Argentina are usually offered) to tour companies and sights. I took a Global Immersion class in Madrid about the European Financial Crisis which included full days of speakers who experienced the crisis first hand and evenings seeing the city, eating a lot of great food, going out to clubs, and touring the soccer stadium.
- NYC. I really only thought about this from a personal perspective coming in but it is a helpful resource since every industry and almost every big company has offices in NY you can find time to meet with people from any industry or company you might be interested in without having to plan your whole day or week around it. I took an immersion seminar last year where every Friday we visited a different consulting firm (BCG, Deloitte, PwC/Strategy&, and 10eqs) and there were a bunch of others offered too (big data, luxury goods, innovation). There are also conferences hosted on or near campus almost every week (I went to the media, marketing and women in business conferences). I just don't see those kind of things being possible outside of NY.

There definitely are some downsides to Columbia as well...
- Business school is expensive and NYC is expensive, put them together and you end up paying a painful amount of money. You pay a premium for being in NY for sure, so if you aren't getting value out of that location then you can probably get a lot of the positives of Columbia somewhere cheaper.
- It is generally understood that our marketing professors aren’t very good. My core marketing class was painful and electives were generally taught by mediocre visiting professors – pretty disappointing when you see the industry legends teaching the finance courses.
- The facilities are...for lack of a better word...bad. It is small and below the standards I would expect from such a great school. Very few dining options and the library is pretty consistently overrun by undergrads.
Tough answering whether it is worth it right out of school (especially for me since I am still on the job hunt). I would say that if you have a good sense of what you want to get out of it and you focus on that it will be worth it (but since priorities vary so much person to person it is also very easy to get distracted).",,,,anyone considering likely considering bunch positive namely access network professor smart classmate professional job everyones favorite grade nondisclosure tell 2 stand location finance classesopportunities chose 10 didnt less worth investment wanted live mainly personal reason surprising level community location orientation weighted towards community side dash class professional scattered throughout sure community despite nobody living location location housing usually international set west coaster throughout weekly happy hour location typically preceded matter 12 cluster 70 core class present life important matter favorite addition location happy hour thursday rugby happy hour wednesday bar transportation stop away open whole rugby team although highly recommend joining rugby team usually equal better attendance schoolsponsored happy hour travelling havent done classmate mainly expensiveoften eats time spending husband job travel summer start chunk community premba international tour includes studentorganized trip pretty international got community final leg hampton 200 classmate fall break cluster organizes trip dominican republic clustermates planned winter spring break job international immersion class learn tour location israel japan south korea india argentina usually offered tour job sight international immersion class madrid european finance crisis included full day speaker experienced crisis hand evening seeing location eating food activity touring soccer stadium thought personal coming helpful resource since industry almost job office time industry job might without plan whole day week around immersion seminar last friday visited consulting job bcg deloitte pwcstrategy 10eqs bunch others offered data luxury innovation conference hosted location location almost week medium marketing woman conference see kind possible outside downside expensive expensive put team end paying painful amount money pay premium sure arent getting value location probably positive somewhere cheaper generally understood marketing professor arent core marketing class painful elective generally taught mediocre visiting professor pretty disappointing see industry legend teaching finance class facility arefor lack better wordbad standard expect dining option library pretty consistently overrun undergrad hard answering whether worth right since job hunt sense worth since priority vary easy distracted,2
Columbia,GMAT Club,"Definitely a top school with a rigorous course load meant to prepare you for business application and solid recruiting networks; however, there a lot to be said for up-and-coming b-schools who are quickly gaining a great alumni base and $$$ and trying to lure good candidates w/ scholarship and shiny new facilities and perks. Be prepared to trade off the NYC-location for slightly less than lackluster facilities and on campus dining/catering (understandable considering NYC is so expensive, but trust me, Uris is not what you would think a top-10 school would look like). Regardless of what the infrastructure is looking like now, the school probably trumps most other similarly ranking schools just based on location.

Columbia,GMAT Club,"CBS is big on CBS. If you want to go here, you have to be very clear about why.

The world is your oyster here. Take advantage of everything New York has to offer, and the huge (40,000+) alumni database.
The social life here is unparalleled. It's been three months and we've already gone to Cancun as a class, had a Gatsby themed Fall Ball and gotten together for dinners, potlucks, sushi and various other gatherings. Columbia's greatest strength is it's awesome, friendly people!

If you are not from a business or ""traditional"" background and are recruiting for banking or consulting, the first semester is EXTREMELY difficult and overwhelming. I would take online courses before school, especially in Excel (if you did not use it in your previous job) so you can feel like you are somewhat on par with your classmates. While CBS has grade non-disclosure, this means you want to fall somewhere in the middle to make sure you are in good academic standing. The ""curve"" makes this very difficult for people who are new to the rigorous core curriculum. Do your best to prepare before school; there simply isn't enough time when you start classes and recruiting to do it all.

Recruiting is extremely well run and CBS will walk you through the process. Join any professional club that is geared toward an industry of interest. They have incredible resources at your disposal. It may be hyper competitive, but everyone will get a job in the end - and a great one at that!

Columbia,GMAT Club,"Although it has been only my first quarter, it already feels like it's been an eternity. In this time I've come to greatly appreciate my classmates, the faculty members, and the resources that are made available to all MBA students. The school does an incredible job of inducting new students into the school, and ensuring that they'll be accommodated an integrated well into the student body.

The Career Management Center takes charge within the first few weeks, and starts educating students in terms of the opportunities available comma and the work that needs to be done in order to get the internship that the students would like.

The professors and faculty members are extremely accommodating, knowledgeable and know their subject well. I was particularly surprised by their ability to integrate humour into classroom situations and to draw on the classroom experience to enrich the case or concept at hand.

The school's location is most definitely one of its key advantages. Just by being in New York City you get to experience so many different things, network with the decision-makers at firms, and hear from industry leaders and experts.

Columbia,GMAT Club,"Going to CBS and participating in the Value Investing Program was easily the best career and life decision I've ever made. I had heard a great deal about the program before I attended but it vastly exceeded my expectations. The quality of students, and even more importantly the faculty and adjunct faculty, cannot be overstated. I was learning directly from some the greatest investors of our generation and that would not have been possible at any other b-school. The opportunity to supplement your learning through internships at NYC hedge funds is huge - this was a key part of my and my fellow investing-oriented classmates education. If you know you want to work on the buyside or any investing-related role, there is no doubt in my mind that CBS is the best place for you.

Every hedge/mutual fund you can think of recruits or has recruited on campus. More importantly, due to CBS' extensive alumni network, you can make in-roads with any fund you want and get in front of them - the rest is up to you. The opportunity is there if you are willing to do the work and put in the time and effort.

Columbia,GMAT Club,"My CBS MBA enabled me to make a career switch into consulting and eventually to start my own (successful) business. Neither would have been possible without the skills, network and confidence the school allowed me to develop.

I was a J-term student: a path I choose primarily because, although I'm American, I had spent nearly all of my adult life out of the US and wanted to be part of a more international community. For a US school, I would say that Columbia ranks at the top f international experience / outlook. (The J-term was about 50% international). I live in London now, and there is a great group of alumni here as well.

It is true that Columbia is most known for its strength is in finance - an area in which I held little interest. That said, I took some great classes in subjects across the board. The ability to choose electives in other programs at Columbia University also provided a unique opportunity to enhance the traditional b-school curriculum with classes in other academic programs that are also among the top rated, both in the US and globally. (The School of Journalism, Teachers College, etc).

Culture-wise, even with such a high contingent of international students, I did find the experience to be quite ""American"" (for lack of a better term). Not necessarily a bad thing, it was just a little adjustment for me to go from chateau champagne parties at INSEAD (where I worked previously) to college-grade beer in student halls at Columbia.

We passed grade non-disclosure the year I was there, and I found the community to be very supportive and, with a few exceptions (there's always one), not overly competitive.

I left the program with lifelong friendships and a business network upon which I draw regularly.

Columbia,GMAT Club,"My first suggestion would be to evaluate schools based on what current students say. Talking to people is the best way to figure out if the school is a good fit for you. There are a lot of stereotypes about schools online that get perpetuated by people who know the stereotype but don't actually know the school.

I had a truly wonderful experience at Columbia. It is a larger school so allows you to be a part of a diverse group with a lot of different backgrounds and a part of an alumni network that is that much larger. It was amazing to meet people from all over the world and with such varied experiences and backgrounds. As large as the student body is, it is still tight-knit and feels much more manageable given the cluster system and the way that you get to meet people through clubs, activities, and recruiting.

One thing that I was nervous about due to stereotypes I read before school was the culture. The stuff I read (and am hoping still doesn't get put out there) could not have been more wrong. I couldn't believe how supportive my classmates and learning teammates were in their willingness to help me both academically and in terms of my career. The community is incredibly strong. Nearly everyone who is there wants to be there and wants to take advantage of the two years. I don't think being in NYC worked against that. It just meant we had more options available to us for our outside of school activities.

In terms of the NYC location, I would say the only negative is that it is really expensive. B School is already expensive and the money you're going to spend on rent/activities/meals/subway will be that much more in NYC. I would say that there also are so many trips/events that happen at school so there is a bit of pressure to spend money if you want to feel like you're fully involved in the community. While this isn't necessarily the way everyone feels, I would point out that some of my friends felt that way. This is especially true in second year as there is a lot more time to travel and you often find yourself on trips with 70+ classmates.

Other than the cost, I couldn't think of a better location to go to business school especially if you're looking to stay on the east coast after school. Because of the NYC location, a lot of our professors are business professionals as well as professors. Not only does this give a unique perspective to what we're learning, but I also had many professors who said they wanted to help people in the class find jobs and were successful in setting classmates up with opportunities. Classes can also get more real-world perspective through projects/internships. I had friends in a venture capital class where each student was given a VC internship for the semester; that sort of experience can't happen everywhere! In addition, there are always business leaders passing through New York, so the companies and the leaders that come to school are just fantastic. I would also add that took advantage of the small business consulting program which gave me really great experience that I leveraged as I made my career switch.

I found the academics at CBS to average, some classes were great, some were just ok. I was so thankful for grade non-disclosure which was something that I didn't originally consider when looking at Bschools. Not only does it help just get rid of that extra layer of stress, but it really makes people that much more willing to help, there is no competition at all.

I really can't say enough about my experience there, I left with lifelong relationships and having secured a job with a company that I had pinpointed before even starting b-school.",,,,suggestion evaluate based current talking figure fit stereotype online perpetuated stereotype actually truly wonderful experience larger allows community diverse team background community network larger international varied experience background large size tightknit manageable given cluster system activity activity job nervous due stereotype read culture stuff read hoping doesnt put wrong couldnt support classmate learn teammate willingness academically semester job community strong nearly everyone advantage worked meant option available u outside activity semester location negative expensive b already expensive money spend rentactivitiesmealssubway tripsevents happen bit pressure spend money fully involved community isnt necessarily everyone point classmate felt true time travel often trip 70 classmate cost couldnt better location stay east coast location professor professional professor unique learn professor said wanted class job successful setting classmate job class realworld projectsinternships classmate venture capital class given vc job semester sort experience cant happen everywhere addition leader passing job leader add advantage consulting experience leveraged job switch found class average class ok thankful grade nondisclosure didnt originally consider bschools rid extra layer stress competition cant enough experience left lifelong relationship secured job job pinpointed starting bschool,2
Columbia,GMAT Club,"CBS is a great program, with amazing faculty, career opportunities and speaker series. CBS is what you expect, it's THE school in Manhattan, which means you have a revolving door of world class speakers / leaders as well as job opportunities that are simply impossible to get if you're not in NYC.

What it's not. It's not a community school. Don't get me wrong, a great sense of community but when you compare it to other programs, as i've done with friends at other schools, it simply can't match the cohesiveness of community. Why? two major reason, 1) the facilities are simply too small, too dated, too spread out, too inadequate and 2) it's NYC, people have limitless options for things to do, so getting the class together is simply tough.

The professors are genuinely awesome. They care, they're working hard for you, they make time for you and they understand that business school is a hybrid product - class work, recruiting, social, networking, etc.

The curriculum is strong and getting stronger though the best classes are tough to get and the schedule for some reason leans heavy on MW class (perhaps due to student interest)

You have to understand a few things about CBS... it's a business... it's a business school. I get a feeling / vibe / inkling that the office of student affairs really doesn't give two craps about the students once we are here. They are in the business of placing you in jobs, getting you good course work, building a world class network. This is not the bschool program that is going to hold your hand or tell you you're special. Some people love this, some hate it, I think it's fair though I don't really appreciate it (esp. with a $200k sticker price).

Columbia,GMAT Club,"On the career front the program at CBS is well designed and I would highly recommend it to anybody interested in Finance and Consulting. The major consulting companies all recruit on campus and the alumni base in finance is incredibly active. Many students have internships during the school year because there are no classes on Fridays. Getting that chance to work for a hedge fund during class can be the difference for many in getting the job they want at graduation. The school is also strengthening the tech/entrepreneurship offerings with a new startup lab. The venture market is New York is growing rapidly and many students start a business with their classmates before reaching graduation.

On the social front the school is very active. The cluster system gives a core group of students you will know well and they travel together, go drinking together and take classes together. The city has more opportunities than you can possibly take advantage of with your limited time. Despite many students having already lived in NYC they still are very active in the school's social scene. The reputation of people scattering after classes is unfounded.

The Core curriculum is not difficult but provides a good foundation and gives the clusters a great chance to bond in their first semester. The electives have a broad selection and the Value Investing Program is unmatched at any other school for access to hedge funds and real world applicability.

Given that it's Yale, academic excellence is expected and the curriculum/workload can be rigorous at times, though there is a robust support system in place. In terms of recruiting, a large number of students pursue finance and consulting, though others also have technology, non-profit, and entrepreneurial interests.

For future applicants, I'd suggest reaching out to current students to gain deeper insight into the community. Don't be afraid to contact Admissions Ambassadors or Club Leaders!

Yale,GMAT Club,"Few opportunities come around that are as life-changing as the Silver Scholar program at SOM was for me - the Silver Scholars program is for students straight out of undergrad to pursue an MBA at SOM. I matriculated in 2012 with the class of 2014 and, due to the parameters of the program, spent two years working full-time at my dream company, and then returned to SOM to complete my final year of courses and study and graduate in 2016. I believe that the Silver Scholars program is representative of the forward-looking direction of SOM and the fact that the institution is not afraid to take risks and innovate.

Over these four years that I was in the program, I was able to see SOM evolve into an even more global business school, with the maturation of the Global Network for Advanced Management. During my second year, I was proud to count over 50% of the student population from different countries, providing a distinctly global feel. Many of my closest friends were from foreign countries and now I feel grateful to have friends from all over the world.

The most remarkable thing about SOM is the community - not just our small and large learning teams, our cohort, our class, or our school, but the fact that SOM strives to be the most closely-integrated business school with it's parent university, which translates into one of the highest percentages of joint-degree candidates and the flexibility to take as many of our electives outside of SOM as you wish. I made countless of friends from SOM, but also from Yale College, the Jackson Institute, the School of Public Health, and the Law School, just to name a few.

This, combined with the immensely tight-knit alumni community that has among the highest rates of annual alumni contributions to their alma mater, makes me confident that I made the right choice - a choice that will continue to pay dividends and a school that I can count on for the duration of my professional career and beyond.

Coming from a social sciences and public policy background in undergrad, SOM's core curriculum provided me the business tools and frameworks to serve as a Senior Manager in the Research and Development division of the company that I returned to after the conclusion of my MBA.

I am grateful for the distinct attention that SOM professors provide their students - frequently going above and beyond the call of duty in helping individuals like me - who overdid it during one of our one-week intensive modules, and got pneumonia. My professors were very understanding and took time to help bring me up to speed, one-on-one on course material, even though they taught hundreds of students at the time. This example is representative of the fact that Professors are passionate about their work and research, but doubly so about teaching students at SOM.

Yale,GMAT Club,"Yale SOM has been a solid experience thus far. I'm currently a 2nd-semester first-year student. The core curriculum is excellent at integrating multiple perspectives. You must do readings for class, or will find that you're not learning much, as much of class time is reserved for discussions of cases.

Evans Hall, the sole facility of Yale SOM, is a high-tech, brand-new building. Visually, it's an incredible place.

The Career office is incredibly helpful for career coaching needs. School seems to land a high number of IB and Consulting internships which do convert successfully into full-time job offers.

While the student body seems low on quant skills, I am hoping that quant-focused electives do not shy away from challenging the student body (I have not yet completed any electives, as we just began them last week).

New Haven is a great city. Good restaurants, and lots of young people (most of whom are yale-affiliated in some way)

Core curriculum is low on quant topics, and most quant-heavy courses (Sourcing & Managing Funds, Operations Engine) have dedicated TA-led weekly review sessions (likely because the student body as a whole seems less comfortable with quantitative topics and needs the extra help).

I did not recruit for IB, but heard anecdotally that most students interested in IB land an offer due to the relatively small number of students hoping to go into banking. The Consulting Club is top-notch at preparing students for case interviews and teh consulting process.

Yale,GMAT Club,"I have been most impressed by the facilities at the school. The SOM campus is breathtaking but I also like the fact that you are not just limited to SOM. You can connect with any part of the wider university. In addition, I really did not expect the level of diversity I have encountered in the school. The school is soooooooo diverse but yet very friendly and collaborative. As an international student, it is highly recommended. However, if you are looking to incubate a business idea, I am not sure SOM is doing a lot in that regard.

Yale,GMAT Club,"Positives:
The community is great. Everyone is very supportive, grade non-disclosure totally matters and helps keep the class from being competitive from each other in a negative way. There are plenty of interesting electives, and if you have anything else you're interested in, there is access to all other parts of Yale (I took a full year of Spanish at the college, for example). Joint degrees are all over the place and always bring an interesting perspective. Consulting is killing it, banking and tech do very well, and the people outside those three top industries often seem to find interesting and unusual work.

Negatives:
As it is a newer school with a slightly smaller alumni network than its peer schools, some of the niche areas (PE/VC, IM) are harder to break into, just by virtue of having fewer people to talk to. I certainly wouldn't mind shortening the core as well. While the focus on the non-profit sector is totally overblown on GMATClub, we do lack some of the really top business backgrounds in the class- not too many from high finance or MBB for example.



Overall: I still think Yale is a buy-low opportunity. Classes have only gotten stronger over the past 15 years or so, and as those alums move up in their jobs the PEVC opportunities will start to come, and the alumni network will become much more powerful. The amount of access to people here is amazing- I went to a speaker session last semester that included John Kerry, Hank Paulson, and Jeff Immelt, and that's just one of the examples of the types of access that Yale as a university can get you.

Yale,GMAT Club,"One of the reasons I joined SOM was because of its upward trajectory in the last few years. Being here I can truly feel that I am a part of something special. We have classmates who gave up positions at higher ranked schools (no scholarship was not a decision making factor) to be a part of this amazing school. The class itself is amazing, with folks from all across the globe with all kinds of experiences. Everyone is supportive, and you feel like you are a part of the family.

The one areas where SOM can improve though is their placement in the tech sector.

Yale,GMAT Club,"The community at Yale SOM is simply amazing. You get to meet people from all over the world and the pool of students is very diverse. In addition to being diverse, everyone has stellar academics and past professional experiences. A truly amazing setting to grow and learn over 2 years.

Whether it is during recruiting or exam season, everyone is helping each other and as a far as I know everyone got the job they wanted from the MBA. It opened me doors to work in top consulting and tech firms in the US during my internship and after graduation. This was one of my main goal coming from Europe.

The fact that SOM is embedded in the greater Yale also helps to expand your learning reach. You can take classes at the law school or any other school on campus.

Finally, New Haven is not New York or Boston but has its benefits. You get to spend a ton of time with your classmates and create deep relationships (since yale is pretty much everything that exists in new haven). It also saves you on expenses since food and rent are much cheaper than in a larger US city.

Yale,GMAT Club,"Folks here are exceptionally smart, driven, and diverse. This is obviously the case with many other top programs as well, but the student body here truly resonates with SOM's mission of educating leaders ""for business and society"". From a career perspective, SOM is particularly strong at sending folks to consulting careers. The much-allured MBB has solidified its presence on campus, and SOM is now considered a core target school for these firms as well as many other consulting firms (Deloitte, Monitor, Parthenon, etc.). The consulting club in particular is especially helpful (it is run like another class) and is structured in a way to maximize success during case interviews.

For other careers (finance, general management, IB), SOM isn't quite as strong yet - as the school continues to build out its reputation though this should change over time. Recruiting within these industries isn't quite as structured and will require a bit more elbow grease on your part. If you put in the effort to network (and take advantage of Yale's brand), you should be okay.

From a curriculum perspective, SOM's integrated curriculum is honestly a hyped-up version of the typical core curriculum offered by other top programs. The big difference here is the ""raw case"" approach (where we are given ALL of the data rather than a subset of case data) , but I'm not sure how valuable this difference is. Electives so far have been good - SOM does have a solid list of professors (John Kerry, Tim Geithner, Jim Chanos, etc.) so the electives can be good.",,,,folk exceptionally smart driven diverse obviously case size truly resonates mission educating leader society job particularly strong sending folk consulting job muchallured mbb solidified presence location considered core target job consulting job deloitte monitor parthenon consulting activity particular helpful run another class structured maximize success case job job finance general management ib isnt quite strong yet continues build reputation though change time job within industry isnt quite structured require bit elbow grease community put hard network advantage brand okay class integrated class honestly hypedup version typical core class offered difference raw case approach given data rather subset case data sure valuable difference elective location solid list professor john kerry tim geithner jim chanos elective,-1

Yale,GMAT Club,"I came into the EMBA with about 10 years of experience in Marketing and a Director role. The program is very high quality, with a lot of attention on the students.
The reason I chose the school was that it was an actual MBA, with the same classes, faculty and class hours as the full-time MBA. I also chose Yale SOM because the curriculum has a great mix of academic classes and more practical workshop-style classes, which makes it easy to bring the learning back to the office on Monday after class.
The school has a unique perspective and philosophy of business and leadership, that they infuse in the teaching and community - and that's very encouraging for those who aspire to lead effectively and make a difference through their business ventures.
The class is a very cohesive group of well-rounded professionals, all senior in their fields, and extremely supportive of each other's growth. The admission team does an excellent job keeping the program relatively small, and being very selective, by making sure they only admit people who will do something great with their MBA. After a year in the class, it really feels like everybody has been growing individually, but also that we have grown as a group.
All in all, it is an excellent program for professionals looking to broaden their understanding of business and gain a more holistic understanding of leadership.

Yale,GMAT Club,"I thought it was an eye-opening, expansive experience as far as my understanding of traditional top-tier MBA programs go. The student body is warm, incredibly bright, fascinating background-wise, and motivated to help each other get through the rigors of the first year curriculum. The curriculum itself is a bit too theoretical and not practical, even though as an intellectually oriented person I found everything fascinating and new. The real benefit in my experience was the amount of people from unconventional backgrounds who had to band together and really help each other out, and those bonds have lasted past business school for sure.

As I was looking to go into food and beverage niches post-graduation, the program was a nice mark on my resume and profile as a candidate for some positions and opportunities, but not directly correlated with my ability to find opportunities. It was a lot of DIY for me, granted I was going into a niche area.

It's very academic in terms of the main subject areas, and while fascinating, does not always lend itself to post-MBA practical skills. but I believe it is being fine-tuned for more of a practical orientation.

Yale,GMAT Club,"Overall, Yale offers a very emotionally supportive environment that is tailored to students and how they feel. They expend many resources on trying to improve the student experience. The courses are low pressure, and grades are not important/not emphasized and your GPA is not shared. However, this program lacks diversity in terms of thought. Many students are very left (liberal) and there is not a conservative perspective that is taught/moderated by professors. This can lead to a frustrating perspective that only represents one ideology which is not realistic. Overall though, the resources are vast, and the reputation and connections will help you get into your desired industry easily if you put in the effort.

Yale,GMAT Club,"The student body is second to none. My classmates made my experience at Yale a fantastic one. They elevated me, helped me, and became my close friends.
As far as I know, Yale is becoming more and more selective. We are starting to see more and more classmates who would have otherwise end up at CBS, Kellogg, Booth, Sloan, and even Wharton if not for Yale's recent meteoric rise in ranking and publicity. As such, quality of students should continue to increase.
The curriculum can be difficult at times, as Yale is particularly strict academic wise. You'll need to prioritize and choose two our of academics, career, and socializing. I picked the latter two because I have a business background and could get by without pounding the books.
Banking, finance, and consulting recruiting is strong. Others are weaker but starting to pick up, particularly in tech.

Yale,GMAT Club,"If you already know what you want from your MBA or career after, you may have already made up your mind and have already crossed Yale off your list or looking forward to the admit call but If you don't, this is the place for you.

The batch size is perfect - not too small that you will lack diversity, and not too big that you have to compete for resources. School's impetus on integrated curriculum and integration with other Yale School's help you find your own career trajectory. This is especially helpful for those who find themselves force fitting in one of the many traditional well-trodden career paths. The integration with parent university gives you access to the wider network of Yale alums which is really helpful.

The school location might be a challenge for those looking to recruit for I-Banking. 2 hour weekly rides (for networking/company event) each way to New York is not fun but manageable. But then, for international students who have never been in the States, it's an easy transition into the American culture here at New Haven. Yale SOM has a new state of the art building. Consulting Companies have a need found liking to the school which I will owe to the money they have invested in the upgrading the facilities.

The student body at Yale SOM is really powerful and work very closely with the administration to have any student issues resolved. The school takes the matter of diversity - gender, ethnicity, sexual orientation etc. very seriously. Given the relatively small size of the batch, you can easily get a position of responsibility in any of the professional/student interest clubs which will help you hone your leadership capabilities and work on your personal network. There are over 80 clubs at SOM. Not to mention the ones available at your disposal at the broader University level.

Another gem in SOM's crown is the GNAM Network. It's a global network of 29 B-schools aimed at a seamless flow of information, knowledge, and experiences. You can do online classes at peer school or do a semester abroad or visit them for networking weeks throughout the years. If you are looking for a global career, this is a goldmine for you. The access and opportunities this network provides are unparallel. I personally was able to find myself internship opportunities through this network.

If you are looking to recruit for consulting, don't think twice this is the school for you. Close to 20% of the class of 2018 was recruited by MBB (Mckinsey Bain & BCG) for the internship.

Yale,GMAT Club,"I chose SOM to transition from traditional consulting to social impact consulting. Some observations:
- SOM is extremely strong for social impact, especially given quality of classmates (many with nonprofit backgrounds), courses offered (e.g. took ""Managing Social Enterprises"", ""Strategic Management of Nonprofit Organizations"" and ""Nonmarket Strategy"" this last semester) and focus on ""business & society"" even in core (accounting, finance, etc) more so than other programs
- Social impact careers are available; financial support through Loan Forgiveness Program for full-time and Internship Fund for summer are great, and there are some former classmates who landed nonprofit jobs with $100k+ salaries (quite an aspiration)
- In addition, all top consulting companies recruit here (got MBB interviews coming up) as well as many of the smaller ones
- Connection to wider Yale is incredible and easy to facilitate; I took graduate classes with School of Forestry and Environment, Global Affairs, School of Music, Philosophy Department, and undergrad classes on Fractal Geometry and Astronomy (at the observatory)
- Student life is great; many events, the student clubs are very active with something for everyone, and the parties are fun

Yale,GMAT Club,"very friendly student body, but infantilizing culture. Finance classes seem great but many employer institutions have not fully bought into that ""brand."" still strong selection for those interested in non profits and social sector, and I think the school and students are getting better at critically addressing the more difficult, uncomfortable parts of educating leaders for business and SOCIETY. For example, talking up the need for environmental friendliness is easy but what about intersectional discrimination that isn't purposeful but happens every day in the workplace, school, etc? I think this is a hard goal that is both made better and yet hampered by a push for rapid increase in global diversity - this comes with good and bad.

You join the SOM community from the first day you set foot on-campus, and immediately you are immersed with your fellow students, the faculty members, and staff.

Faculty is a huge aspect of my SOM experience. They know your names, your background, your interests. They encourage students to take courses regardless of your experience -- they take the time to make sure you're learning what you WANT to learn, what you're interested in ... and give you the opportunity to shape your business experience. And they get to know you outside of class through barbecues at their houses, workouts at the gym, and hanging out at SOM.
